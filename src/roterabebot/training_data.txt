No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. end$

I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty’s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old. end$
It is this fate, I solemnly assure you, that I dread for you, when the time comes that you make your reckoning, and realize that there is no longer anything that can be done. May you never find yourselves, men of Athens, in such a position! Yet in any case, it were better to die ten thousand deaths, than to do anything out of servility towards Philip [or to sacrifice any of those who speak for your good]. A noble recompense did the people in Oreus receive, for entrusting themselves to Philip’s friends, and thrusting Euphraeus aside! And a noble recompense the democracy of Eretria, for driving away your envoys, and surrendering to Cleitarchus! They are slaves, scourged and butchered! A noble clemency did he show to the Olynthians, who elected Lasthenes to command the cavalry, and banished Apollonides! It is folly, and it is cowardice, to cherish hopes like these, to give way to evil counsels, to refuse to do anything that you should do, to listen to the advocates of the enemy’s cause, and to fancy that you dwell in so great a city that, whatever happens, you will not suffer any harm. end$
what do ya say? end$
Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort? end$
In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility — I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it — and the glow from that fire can truly light the world. end$
And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country. end$
My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man. end$
We’ve grown used to wonders in this century. It’s hard to dazzle us. But for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that. We’ve grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we’ve only just begun. We’re still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers. end$
And I want to say something to the school children of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle’s takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It’s all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It’s all part of taking a chance and expanding man’s horizons. The future doesn’t belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we’ll continue to follow them…… end$
The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and ‘slipped the surly bonds of earth’ to ‘touch the face of God.’ end$

Some one will say: Yes, Socrates, but cannot you hold your tongue, and then you may go into a foreign city, and no one will interfere with you? Now I have great difficulty in making you understand my answer to this. For if I tell you that to do as you say would be a disobedience to the God, and therefore that I cannot hold my tongue, you will not believe that I am serious; and if I say again that daily to discourse about virtue, and of those other things about which you hear me examining myself and others, is the greatest good of man, and that the unexamined life is not worth living, you are still less likely to believe me. end$

Frederick Walter Stephen West (29 September 1941 – 1 January 1995) was an English serial killer who committed at least 12 murders between 1967 and 1987 in Gloucestershire, the majority with his second wife, Rosemary West. end$
All the victims were young women. At least eight of the murders involved the Wests' sexual gratification and included rape, bondage, torture and mutilation; the victims' dismembered bodies were typically buried in the cellar or garden of the Wests' Cromwell Street home in Gloucester, which became known as the House of Horrors. Fred also committed at least two murders on his own, and Rose murdered Fred's stepdaughter, Charmaine. The couple were apprehended and charged in 1994. end$
Fred West asphyxiated himself while on remand at HM Prison Birmingham on 1 January 1995, at which time he and Rose were jointly charged with nine murders, and he with three further murders. In November 1995, Rose was convicted of ten murders and sentenced to ten life terms with a whole life order. end$
Murder of Anne McFall end$
In July 1967,[47] McFall, aged 18 and eight months pregnant with Fred's child, vanished. She was never reported missing, but her dismembered remains were found buried at the edge of a cornfield between Much Marcle and Kempley in June 1994. Her limbs had been carefully disarticulated, and many phalange bones were missing from her body—likely to have been retained as keepsakes; her unborn child may also have been cut from her womb.[48] Fred initially denied he had killed McFall, but confided to one visitor following his arrest that he had stabbed her to death following an argument. This explanation is inconsistent with the fact that her wrists were found with sections of dressing gown cord wrapped around them, suggesting she had been restrained prior to her murder.[49] end$
The following month, Rena returned to live with Fred, and the couple relocated to the Lake House Caravan Park. Their relationship initially improved, but Rena left the following year, again leaving the children in his care. On these occasions when Fred had no woman to supervise and care for the girls, he temporarily placed them in the care of Gloucester social services.[50] end$

Theodore Robert Bundy (born Theodore Robert Cowell; November 24, 1946 – January 24, 1989) was an American serial killer, kidnapper, rapist, burglar, and necrophile who assaulted and murdered numerous young women and girls during the 1970s and possibly earlier. Shortly before his execution and after more than a decade of denials, he confessed to 30 homicides that he committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. The true victim count is unknown and could be much higher. end$
Many of Bundy's young female victims regarded him as handsome and charismatic, which were traits that he exploited to win their trust. He would typically approach them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes for hours at a time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and for a period of time, he kept some of the severed heads as mementos in his apartment.[3] On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept. end$
In 1975, Bundy went to jail for the first time when he was incarcerated in Utah for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault. He then became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in multiple states. Facing murder charges in Colorado, he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults, including three murders, before his ultimate recapture in Florida in 1978. For the Florida homicides, he received three death sentences in two separate trials. end$
Bundy was executed in the electric chair at Florida State Prison on January 24, 1989.[4] Biographer Ann Rule described him as a sadistic sociopath who took pleasure from another human's pain and the control he had over his victims, to the point of death, and even after.[5] He once called himself the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you'll ever meet;[6][7] Attorney Polly Nelson—a member of his last defense team—wrote: Ted was the very definition of heartless evil.[8] end$

In the ancient world, sailors returning corpses to their home country were often accused of necrophilia.[5] Singular accounts of necrophilia in history are sporadic, though written records suggest the practice was present within Ancient Egypt. Herodotus writes in The Histories that, to discourage intercourse with a corpse, ancient Egyptians left deceased beautiful women to decay for three or four days before giving them to the embalmers.[6][7][8] Herodotus also alluded to suggestions that Greek tyrant Periander had defiled the corpse of his wife, employing a metaphor: Periander baked his bread in a cold oven.[9] Acts of necrophilia are depicted on ceramics from the Moche culture, which reigned in northern Peru from the first to eighth century CE.[10] A common theme in these artifacts is the masturbation of a male skeleton by a living woman.[11] Hittite law from the 16th century BC through to the 13th century BC explicitly permitted sex with the dead.[12] end$
In Renaissance Italy, following the reputed moral collapse brought about by the Black Death and before the Roman Inquisition of the Counter-Reformation, the literature was replete with sexual references; these include necrophilia, in the case of the epic poem Orlando Innamorato by Matteo Maria Boiardo, first published in 1483.[13] In a notorious modern example, American serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer was a necrophiliac. Dahmer wanted to create a sex slave that would mindlessly consent to whatever he wanted. When his attempts failed, and his male victim died, he would keep the corpse until it decomposed beyond recognition, continuously masturbating and performing sexual intercourse on the body.[14] In order to be aroused, he had to murder his male victims before performing sexual intercourse with them. Dahmer stated that he only killed his victims because they wanted to leave after having sex, and would be angry with him for drugging them.[15] British serial killer Dennis Nilsen is also considered to have been a necrophiliac.[16] end$

He probably does end$
In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), recurrent, intense sexual interest in corpses can be diagnosed under Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder (necrophilia) when it causes marked distress or impairment in important areas of functioning.[17] A ten-tier classification of necrophilia exists:[18] end$
Role players: People who get aroused from pretending their live partner is dead during sexual activity. end$
Romantic necrophiliacs: Bereaved people who remain attached to their dead lover's body. end$
Necrophilic fantasizers: People who fantasize about necrophilia, but never actually have sex with a corpse. end$
Tactile necrophiliacs: People who are aroused by touching or stroking a corpse, without engaging in intercourse. end$
Fetishistic necrophiliacs: People who remove objects (e.g., panties or a tampon) or body parts (e.g., a finger or genitalia) from a corpse for sexual purposes, without engaging in intercourse. end$
Necromutilomaniacs: People who derive pleasure from mutilating a corpse while masturbating, without engaging in intercourse. end$
Opportunistic necrophiliacs: People who normally have no interest in necrophilia, but take the opportunity when it arises. end$
Regular necrophiliacs: People who preferentially have intercourse with the dead. end$
Homicidal necrophiliacs: Necrosadists,[19] people who commit murder in order to have sex with the victim. end$
Exclusive necrophiliacs: People who have an exclusive interest in sex with the dead, and cannot perform at all for a living partner. end$

“Murder is not about lust and it’s not about violence. It’s about possession.” end$
“We serial killers are your sons, we are your husbands, we are everywhere. And there will be more of your children dead tomorrow.” end$
“You feel the last bit of breath leaving their body. You’re looking into their eyes. A person in that situation is God!” end$
“You learn what you need to kill and take care of the details. It’s like changing a tire. The first time you’re careful. By the thirtieth time, you can’t remember where you left the lug wrench.” end$
“What’s one less person on the face of the earth, anyway?” end$
“I separated the joints, the arm joints, the leg joints, and had to do two boilings. I think I used four boxes of Soilex for each one, put in the upper portion of the body and boiled that for about two hours and then the lower portion for another two hours. The Soilex removes all the flesh, turns it into a jelly like-like substance and it just rinses off. Then I laid the clean bones in a light bleach solution, left them there for a day and spread them out on either newspaper or cloth and let them dry for about a week in the bedroom.” end$
“Yes, I do have remorse, but I’m not even sure myself whether it is as profound as it should be. I’ve always wondered myself why I don’t feel more remorse.” end$
“I was completely swept along with my own compulsion. I don’t know how else to put it. It didn’t satisfy me completely, so maybe I was thinking, ‘Maybe another one will. Maybe this one will.’ And the numbers started growing and growing and just got out of control, as you can see.” end$
“I’ve got to start eating at home more.” end$
“I just wanted to see how it felt to shoot Grandma.” end$
“I remember there was actually a sexual thrill . . . you hear that little pop and pull their heads off and hold their heads up by the hair. Whipping their heads off, their body sitting there. That’d get me off.” end$
“I was literally singing to myself on my way home, after the killing. The tension, the desire to kill a woman had built up in such explosive proportions that when I finally pulled the trigger, all the pressures, all the tensions, all the hatred, had just vanished, dissipated, but only for a short time.” end$
Truly the stuff of nightmares, Gacy led a double life as Pogo the Clown. Dressed up for children’s parties, the killer clown murdered and sexually assaulted at least 33 men and boys in the early ‘70s. Asphyxiation or strangulation were his speciality, and he stored the bodies of his victims in the crawl space of his house, elsewhere on his property or in a nearby river. He was executed by lethal injection in 1994. end$

&gt; As you know, we’ve been hiring rapidly this financial year. In fact we’ve had over 600 new people join, and 400 new roles created in that time! This was a planned and conscious decision as this was a year of investment into our strategy.  :eyes: end$
strange, I got a feeling 400 old people quit end$
lol end$
that's what she said end$
i think the quits explains the 200 difference between people and roles end$
I wonder if creating 400 new roles is a good thing end$
wat end$

400 times. end$

&gt; You might be surprised how common that is. At my previous company, all of the persistent applications were set up to automatically kill themselves and restart every night, because apparently things got weird if you left them running too long end$
try harder end$
oh yes end$
I had the cronjob (my invention) end$
that would kill everything at 3:00 end$
and there was one medical office that was always complaining end$
and I couldn't figure out what on earth is happening end$
weeks or months fast forward and I figure out that they are actually not shutting down their computers at the end of the day end$
Sor, I send you half the kidney I took from one woman presarved it for you tother pirce I fried and ate it was nice. I may send you the bloody knife that took it out if you only wait a while longer. Signed. Catch me when you can mister Lusk. end$
you "had" the cronjob? end$
When this monster enter my brain, I will never know. But it here to stay. Society can be thankful that there are ways for people like me to relieve by daydreams of some victim being torture. It a big complicated game my friend of the monster play putting victims number down. Follow them, checking up on them, waiting in the dark, waiting, waiting… maybe you can stop him. I can’t. He has already chosen his next victim end$
We think that the decisive role played by feelings of inferiority, low self esteem, powerlessness, identification with victims by people who are not themselves victims, is a peculiarity of modern leftism. Identification with victims by people not themselves victims can be seen to some extent in 19th century leftism. end$
yes and I'm sure they still have it end$
You mean you added it after you found out about their non-restarts? end$
ah no end$
dante what is he on about end$
:jebaited: end$
for some reasons closing the connection to the client would sometimes leak resources on the server end$
dante, resources, have you heard of it? end$
marenz, but only "playground" has the AST of your debugging pragma \_()_/ end$
so you would have a lot of server resources just hanging and that would accumulate end$
&gt;  You might be surprised how common that is. At my previous company, all of the persistent applications were set up to automatically kill themselves and restart every night, because apparently things got weird if you left them running too long end$
wow what a silly place to work at. This would never happen at sociomantic. end$
my quick solution would be to just kill all servers over night because the work hours are from 9-17 end$
<@U02V5PSUE> are we.,.. restarting .. apps.. periodically? end$
what? that has never happened ever end$
ever ever end$
neverever end$
noooo end$
:monkey_face: end$
never happened with coral ever end$
what is coral end$
<@U0H6ECEGG> okay. And the non-restarts happened where? end$
dante, reporting team is full of shit :P end$
marenz, nah that was earlier passed to suspend dmq input right? end$
the problem was that people would not close their clients end$
so they would hangup end$
when I kill all servers end$
and? end$
well nothing end$
:gomes: :alienguy: end$
:slightly_smiling_face: end$
that's the end of the story end$
I feel I got only bits and pieces of the story end$
&gt; All bureaucracy was abandoned in favor of: everyone has root in order to do whatever it takes on-the-fly, no approvals required end$
Isn't that how we work? end$

spilled php I see end$

Aah, beautiful end$
&gt;  The first tasks Alona needed to grab off the backlog didn't have anything to do with the threads, so she spent a few days just writing code, until she picked up a bug which was obviously caused by a race condition. end$
From what she'd seen in the documentation and the code, that meant the problem had to be somewhere in MainComputationThread. She wasn't sure where it was defined, so she just did a quick search for the term class MainComputationThread. end$
It returned twenty hits. There was no class called MainComputationThread, though there was an interface. There were also classes which implemented that interface, named things like MainComputationThread1 and MainComputationThread17. A quick diff showed that all twenty of the MainComputationThreadn classes were 1,243 lines of perfectly identical code. end$
They were also all implemented as singletons. end$

Hi, end$
I was literally just about to book some tickets to Bristol and back for myself, but I am having second thoughts. If it's possible to still arrange and book flights via you guys, I'd like that! If not, I'll stick to my original plan of getting my own flights. end$

Andrea: I made a HUGE mistake, I hit this guy on the head with my laptop. There is blood everywhere! Porco dio, I have killed him!!! end$
Dave: I seem to have happened upon this gentleman lying on the ground. He's not moving and appears to be bleeding. Please advise, thank you, David. end$

Cheers, Jo end$
crisis averted end$
no need to inform big dan about this mess end$
this is one of my favorite e-mails from Tom end$
&gt; Andrej, end$
&gt; end$
&gt; end$
&gt; first of all happy new year and I appreciate your open words. Something like this can happen but you need to always remind yourself about what’s the most simple way of doing things and if it’s really necessary. If somebody asks for your help give yourself a few days and discuss with others. Create a ticket and ask for input on what the easiest ways is to do this. The tracking team has a lack of basic shell/bash knowledge that for sure. If you wanna help them than fix that problem and this way you also scale yourself ;-) end$
&gt; end$
The part about tracking team makes me laugh every time. This was back when tracking was Diogo / Mouse / Michelle / Nico end$
ah also I cut out: end$
&gt; @Daniel/Luca: Can you help of fixing the knowledge gap of Diego’s tracking team on how to use Python/Bash scripts end$
lol end$
"diego" end$
I miss Diego end$
oh man I just remembered when he called me Scott. In person. end$
after working for him for 3 years end$
I have also been Scott I think end$
and probably Andrej too end$
I've also been Hans many times end$
we are all Andrej on this blessed day end$
two e-mails before that it was end$
&gt; Well I have an entire problem with that you are wasting time you’re not having on requests like that. Please stop working asap on the topic. I step already in once to stop the entire thread and I’m surprise to still see this coming. This is now a formal advice: STOP WORKING ON THIS ASAP! end$

yep definitely they can't co-exist in the server end$
dante is a bit too rude end$
isn't it just a config file for the channels? end$
no, you can invite him anywhere but he is purposefully silent in non-approved channels (so he doesn't leak secret) end$
ah! end$
well you can always run a copy of dante just to join only this channel end$
that printout is of course out of date end$
well you know what? I'll fork dante and make a roterabe-bot friendly dante just for this channel :smile: end$

                +     -->  HACKING ATM'S  <-- end$
   Welcome everybody to my first article dealing with the manipulation of th end$
   Bank's Automated Teller Machines for the gain of money. end$
   In this article I will show you many ways to 'beat' the system. Some method end$
   of hacking into ATM's are very easy and others are a bit more difficult end$
   I suggest you pick the method that mostly suits you end$
   Okay Lets get straight into it... end$
1.0     Different types of Automatic Teller end$
=========================================== end$
There are 3 major types of Automatic teller machines end$
IB end$
== end$
The first of these (and the most popular) is the IBM model. This is easil end$
distinguised from the others by the IBM logo in the top right hand corner o end$
the front of the machine end$
This unit features a touch sensitive keypad and a 1 line display with a viso end$
that moves up and down. (The newer models have a 5 line display). end$
NC end$
== end$
The second unit is the NCR unit, which is MUCH smaller than than the IBM fron end$
panel. This unit has a small VDU as well as a touch sensitive keypad. The onl end$
banks that seem to be using this unit in Australia is the 'STATE BANK' o end$
Victoria, so you will not see many of them around end$
PHILIP end$
====== end$
The third and final unit is made by Philips as is only used by the credi end$
unions or Building Societys. This is usually known as 'CASHCARD'. These unit end$
feature a push-button keyboard and a VDU (like the NCR) end$
All these above units provide the same functions.. end$
1.1   Information on the Plastic Card end$
===================================== end$
The Plastic Cards that you put into these cash carrying monsters have a Numbe end$
that is printed on the front of the card (which is also the same number, tha end$
is stored on the MAGNETIC STRIP on the back of the card. end$
What do these numbers mean???? end$
Well here is some information on them.. end$
The Numbers are split up into 2 groups, the first group ALWAYS contain end$
SIX numbers while the second group contains anywhere between 6 to 1 end$
numbers end$
EG)         560192 301256521478 end$
            \ /\ end$
             |  |__ This 3 digit number identifies the Bank end$
 end$
             |__ This is the Australian ID code and ALL banks have this end$
   Some ID's for bank end$
   ================== end$
         192   -  Westpac Banking Corporatio end$
         251   -  National Australia Ban end$
         220   -  Commenwealth Ban end$
The Second part of the number seems to be a jumble of digits for 6 to 13, whic end$
only seem to make sense to the banks computer end$
The banks computer simply looks the second number up in a Table and finds ou end$
your assigned PIN number (A password for your card consisting of 4 digits) end$
and any other information. eg) Your savings account no. Cheque a/c etc end$
Since the four Digit PIN (Personal Identification Numbers) range from 0000 t end$
9999, then more than one person has the same PIN number for his card. (Banks d end$
have more that 10,000 customers !! end$
Okay now that we have some simple background information we can learn how t end$
'defeat' the system. end$
1.2   The "CABLE CUTTER METHOD end$
============================== end$
For this method you will require the Follwing end$
  (1) -  Gut end$
  (2) -  Good Pair of SIDCHROME cutter end$
  (3) -  Fake ID (library cards, Concession Cards etc. end$
Okay the First Step is to open up a bank savings account at one of the bank end$
that gives you access to the ATM. end$
The Major banks have the following Packages end$
   Westpac  - Advantage Save end$
   National - Flexi Car end$
   C'wealth - Key Car end$
I suggest you go for National Bank as their limit is $500 per day, wher end$
Westpac has a $200 Max Limit per day. end$
Give them an address where you can check the mail everyday (so you can receiv end$
your card and PIN number)...An old house etc. will do very well end$
Make sure you open the account at a 'small' suburb branch, that has compute end$
equipment installed end$
Once you have finally received your brand new savings account with fake nam end$
and addreYour account record is kept at your branches computer. So what the mai end$
computer does is get in touch with the branches (on the network) and ask i end$
information on your account. (Balance etc.) end$
Ok so what do we do with the cutters??? Well go to your banks branch (at abou end$
10.00 - 11.00 pm), Find the Concrete Telecom cover near the bank and lift i end$
off using the handle of the Cutters end$
Ok, See if there are cables leading from the main tube into a smaller tube tha end$
leads underground into the bank...Well take your cutters and snip them..Ok wel end$
congratulations you have just cut the phone cables for all their phones an end$
their branch computer system. end$
If you wanna be a bit more sure that you cut the cable to the computer, Sni end$
every cable in sight of the bank. (Use insulated cutters and don't be afraid o end$
the sparks and mini fire works. end$
Ok the banks compuer should be disabled now, so go to the nearest ATM you ca end$
find and pop your card in and try to do a ' ACCOUNT BALANCE '. You should get end$
NOT AVAILABLE - try again Later ERROR..If you do then start jumping up an end$
down cause you have done it! end$
You see the main computer is programmed to give you whatever money you ask fo end$
when the lines are down, so they will not inconvenience the customers. So punc end$
in the max. LIMIT any time before 12 midnight and then take out another batc end$
after 12.00 midnight (or whatever other time you can). end$
When they Fix the Lines, the main computer will update the balance in th end$
branches computer... (he he). Your account will have a Debit Balance and th end$
bank manager will come after you..But he won't find you will he! end$
The major banks that to use this new system are:  Westpac and National end$
I have tried it with both banks and it works great. Although I prefer Nationa end$
Bank since you can make $1,000 in a few minutes end$
<@U02V5PSUE> yeah end$

hmm end$
lol the app which I'm gonna work on in the next months looks very promising <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.huyuapp&amp;showAllReviews=true> end$
Funny enough, Same problem as everyone else. Uploaded one receipt then wouldn't scan others after that. No help option on app and I can see they aren't replying on here to peoples negative feedback to assure them it's going to be fixed. Seems dodgy to me. There just trying to scam people's info to sell on I think!!!! Deleting asap. end$
seems dodgy to me end$
yep end$
dante? end$
stefan yeah someone could review this P.R. merge-worthy end$
it is end$
if i search for HuYu in google play on my phone i get a completely different app also called HuYu end$
but not this one end$
:skeptical: end$
LOL end$
:dunnhumby-grey: :alienguy: end$
that one has decent ratings end$
link bitte end$
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.huyu&amp;hl=en> end$
stefan end$
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ end$
hmm end$
dantewhat do ya say? end$
andrea.imparato, holding end$
andrea.imparato, nice end$
dunnhumbys version looks like a shitty chinese copy that does something completely different than you expect it to end$
like buying a fake rolex only to find out that it's actually a barometer rather than a time keeper end$
```The logic around the app is brill - upload receipts, get points, convert to £££. However the reality is quite different. When you take a pic (note only one, have a large receipt from a big shop? Don’t even try) it says it is ‘doing magic’. What that means is it’s looking for where you bought it and date it was bought. 75% of the time you are then rejected here. Yes the app gives ‘reasons why’ this happens but there is no way to say ‘actually. Your magic is wrong. This is a legit receipt’ end$
The other downside is the huge restrictions on the receipts accepted. There are many more apps out there that do exactly the same as this one (and work!) with a much larger pool of accepted stores end$
I’d expected much more of this app when you consider it’s owned by Tesco (Dunnhumby is a subsidiary if them!) end$
``` end$
lets write some reviews for this <https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dh-alumni/id1432699350?mt=8> end$
dante pls :point_up: end$
"sociomantic culture" end$
lol end$
"sociomantic culture" :alienguy: end$

do you work for :dunnhumby-grey: ?dante end$

nice app. end$
the app doesn't even show up when I search for huyu on google play end$
can I use HuYu to collect görlitzer park loyalty points? end$
yeah same end$
i get the other HuYu end$
or another one shows up by "technotonic solution" end$
:genau: end$
how can there be two apps with the same name? end$
:alienguy: end$
different global markets end$
it has a fidget spinner for its logo end$
also I think you can just.. use the same name on the app store end$
maybe huyh only shows up in UK end$
not totes sure tho end$
these reviews look legit end$
"A Google user" is my best friend IRL end$
as for the real huyu app end$
&gt;  Doesn't work... Keeps rejecting receipts as old even if they are from same da end$
lol end$
all reviews complain about the app not doing its job end$
&gt; Dear User, It is likely that you hit the limit of '10 receipts per 7 days'. This setup is to stop potential excessive uploading of receipts end$
wtf end$
can't handle more than 10 requests a week? end$
AND this app runs on the cloud!!!!! end$
_S C A L A B L E_ end$
in the butt!!!! end$
praise the cloud!!!! end$
you remember when :recursivebob: posted that link about google vision on <#C02V4DEFP|general-rnd> ? end$
yes this is the shit why the scan doesn't work :ok_hand: end$
i dont think so end$
why not just put QR codes on the receipts or something end$
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ end$
well probably because not all the supermakets are updated or smth end$
&gt; Can I upload someone else’s receipts end$
&gt; Yes, as long as the person lives in your household. Anyone outside your household doesn’t count – and uploading their receipts will be treated as fraudulent activity end$
they gonna call the cops on you end$
lol end$
but yeah basically the whole app is just a regex end$
on the receipts data sent back from google vision end$

<https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9s5qi2/ibm_acquires_red_hat/> end$
&gt; The merger happened over the course of a year, and spread well into the year after that first one as well. It was fairly painless for me, up until the point where we had to start using IBM's software/web portals for PTO, tracking sick days, tracking vacation, any HR related request, and, worst of all, helpdesk-related requests. end$

<@U0H6ECEGG> sounds oddly familiar but I can't put my finger on it end$

hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm end$
it triggers some reflex for me, but I'm not sure why end$
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM end$
maybe it's just sounds very terrible? end$
HUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM end$
by end$
Haha. My thoughts were the same, initially. In the short term (and at the price they paid), my wallet looks great. But for the long-term, I know the 50% of these acquisitions don't end with the parent company letting the child operate as a separate entity. It ends with them "integrating" and cullin end$
So that's disheartening end$
Still, much like all of you, I will wait to see what happens for a bit end$
Time at RedHat has been fantastic thus far end$
dante DH is full of hot girls end$
THIS THREAD IS TOO REAL end$
stefan yes pls end$
lol end$
lol end$
From a biz point of view, it doesn't really make sense for them to touch RH operations. The real value of our company is our culture &amp; open source name end$
But then again, maybe that's just the naivety of "Maybe this time it'll be different!", setting in end$
oh god end$
haha end$
You'll get an email next week, it's probably already sent. It will talk about the merger and how IBM loves Red Hat, its people, its culture, its technology, and they don't plan on changing much at all because... why mess with success end$
Unfortunately, whether they mean any of it or not, that's not the way these things tend to play out end$
As Red Hat is assimilated, it's culture will die. Lots of people will move on for various reasons. A lot of paying customers will leave because dealing with IBM will be a very, very different experience. A lot of Red Hat users will find a new distro solely because they don't want to use IBM's version of Linux end$
At some point, Red Hat's pieces will get chopped away and moved into their new homes within IBM. They'll use terms like "win win" and "natural fit". They'll have quotes from the various big shots where they talk about how they've been working together more and more over the years so it "just makes sense" end$
If you could see 10 years into the future, Red Hat probably won't exist except as a Linux distro brand. end$
is this real life end$
&gt; Red Hat probably won't exist except as a Linux distro brand. end$
I love this part end$
It took like 6 months from the announced deal until they told me to start using Lotus Notes when they acquired my last company. end$
IBM uses an insanely large web portal...thing, for all of that and more. Submitting requests became tedious and downright frustrating at times because of the number of hoops you'd jump through just to begin speaking with an actual human, who is 90% of the time someone outsourced and providing 'support' from a call center. end$

LeChuck's revenge end$
how do you not know this end$
<@U034YC4SY> hows the smoko office end$
two man army right now end$
Despite my reputation I don't actually know many games end$
how is your factory doing? end$
i just built a rocket silo last night end$
now to launch an actual rocket... end$
need a shit ton of rocket parts end$
i have gone from not having enough iron to not having nearly enough copper end$
Do you have trains? end$
and my brilliant train network that i ~haphazardly farted out~ painstakingly planned out has a billion chokepoints end$
ah end$
trains are fun though end$
How are the natives treating you? end$
smoko is open for business opportunities end$
once i launch my rocket im gonna start a new factory I think end$
i play with biters off end$
did you say hello with a tank? end$
i dont really enjoy that part of the game end$
i just like building and automating end$
yeah, it can be annoying end$
aight end$
my tactic is: Build a shitload of drones and just walk to the aliens end$
dante I'll do some vaping soon end$
andrea.imparato no end$
just stand there and the drones do everything end$
i havent even tried robots or logistics networks yet end$
or nuclear power end$
so much to learn still end$
nuclear.. that's new end$
lolol end$
yeah there's uranium ore that you need sulfuric acid to mine end$
pick up stefi end$
gotta connect pipes to your drills end$
they didn't have that when I played it last time end$
so you don't have flying helper robots? end$
no my robo port takes too much power from my modular armor that my night vision doesnt work end$
okay, that looks like i have to play it again end$
but now i have researched portable fusion cells so maybe i can look into it end$
you don't need a mobile port end$
lol@stefi end$
dante stefi end$
how odd end$
i lay everything down manually like a peasant end$
also holy shit are blue belts expensive end$
80 iron gears for an underground one, on top of 40 to make a red one first end$
plus lube end$
so much lube end$
never enough lube end$
just build ports all over your factory end$
it builds up a nice networks end$
you place a blueprint, robots come flying and build everything end$
and also repair end$
i always carry a few repair kits with me end$
with biters off i dont really need to automate repairs end$
only when i drive into inserters and power poles with my car... end$
why is it impossible to drive in a straight line end$
because you're 24/7 drunk? end$
i wish end$
more like 5/2 end$
biters off means no aliens at all? end$
:genau: end$
need a shit ton of blue circuits, which need a shit ton of green circuits, which need a shit ton of copper, bla bla bla end$
also just figured out that i can put wires between inserters and buffer chests to make the inserters only run when the chest has a certain amount of items in it end$
amazing stuff end$
when do you need that? end$
loading/unloading trains end$
i have my trains set to wait until 5 seconds of inactivity end$
but if your inserters are working sporadically every 1-2 seconds, they will never leave the station end$
though my train network is a gigantic piece of shit and i need to rethink it from scratch end$
why are you not at the smoko table end$
omw end$
we could play coop some time end$
sure thing end$
<!here> anyone else play factorio? its amazing end$

This has now been removed and will be replaced with a ‘unisex’ sign in the coming days.``` end$

bah. The maidsafe ppl said I should get more Rust experience and apply again end$
grumble mumble grumble end$
Seems like a weird requirement, I would have assumed they'd accept you given the notice period (time to learn) and the fact that you (probably?) learned D for this job end$
I actually knew D before starting here end$
Do they have an abundance of rust developers!? end$
Ah ok end$
By "Rust experience" people mostly think: anything done in rust end$
Maybe they are not looking urgently enough end$
I thought you already had an offer? end$
I do end$
(from another company) end$
Yeah end$
Doesn't mean I can't keep looking ;)- end$
did you accept the offer? end$
Verbally yes end$
how long do you have to sign? end$
And they said they send me over the contract to check it end$
and that was like 2 weeks ago end$
I have used this successfully as a rust experience reference and it took me a week I guess: <https://github.com/Burgos/micoos> end$
Ah right end$
well maybe you need to call them :slightly_smiling_face: end$
Well, as I am still waiting for a response from another company I am not too much in a hury end$
:smile: end$
what are your thoughts on rust <@U0H6ECEGG> end$
I actually have a good feeling about it. end$
the language as language - it takes you few weeks to get it in your fingers and to start writing idiomatic Rust code end$
I did a rust homework for applying to one company here and they were impressed, and the code was implementing common algorithms. Turns out it's very different to implement them in Rust then in C because of the borrow-checker, so I can see how that can push people starting away end$
the community is super vibrant, like D has no chance in competing there end$
but we have glorious leaders Andrei and Walter end$
and there tens of people working on say embedded rust end$
I miss fibers in rust end$
implement them yourself end$
its only two functions end$
setctx()? ;) end$
`Fiber.yield()` `fiber.call()` end$
right, should be easy end$
do you find it easier to write bug-free code in rust compared to D? end$
I guess not end$
why not end$
because of GC :wink: end$
and it's certainly not _easier_ end$
Doesn't rust have all those memory constructs to make it difficult to "lose" memory? end$
yeah but D has GC end$
I feel like maybe DIP 1000 makes it possible to do similar stuff in D end$
the GC that sucks? end$
also, CTFE? end$
I've also read somewhere that rust is gonna get a GC in some future version end$
no that's C++ :smile: end$
but yeah, it's possible that rust gets GC as a library (same as C++) end$
well I dunno end$
oh another thing I've read is that rust's compilation time is quite slow for anything bigger than a small project end$
have you ever compiled a C++ project end$
I compiled LLVM the other day end$
boy... end$
some say he's still compiling to this day end$
I think it's still compiling end$
:smile: end$
take away: I think rust is nice and it has all the hype and I can't foresee that this hype will go away. Will it be used seriously: probably Will C still rule the world: yeah end$
will people still write COBOL: yeah end$
will Andrei Alexandrescu move to Rust next: end$
maybe? end$
<https://www.quora.com/Which-language-has-the-brightest-future-in-replacement-of-C-between-D-Go-and-Rust-And-Why/answer/Andrei-Alexandrescu> end$
tldr: end$
&gt; D has no vision. Go is out of its depth. Rust skipped leg day. ( end$
me_irl end$
<https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3sa6lf/d_has_no_vision_go_is_out_of_its_depth_rust/?st=joeivuqg&amp;sh=7fcd6882> end$
&gt; Foreign syntax. Rust's syntax is different, and there's no apparent advantage to the difference. This is irritating for folks coming from Algol-style languages, who need to deal with a gratuitously different syntax in addition to getting the resource bookkeeping right end$
This is where it gets interesting. I don't see a lot of C++ people taking Rust compared to people that used to python/ruby/javascript end$
there are legions of ruby people (early on there was a book rust for ruby developers) moving to rust end$

I had sex in my dreams and was told I'm out of the game end$
:smile: end$
there's a long debate about dream rules on /r/nonutnovember end$
I say if you have a lucid dream and do it you are out end$
but if it's unintentional you are still in end$
<@U02V5S8CR> ```For every day that you did not complete in November, you will have to complete an equivalent amount of days of Destroy-Dick December end$
For example, if you lasted until November 28th, there are 3 days prior to the end of November (including the 28th) in which you failed. So for a chance at making it up, you will have to masturbate once on the 1st, twice on the 2nd, and three times on the 3rd. Easy right? Well you deserve it for having made it so far end$
But let's say you weren't able to resist temptation and failed on November 12th. That's 19 days of which you failed the challenge. To make up for it you will have to masturbate once on the 1st, twice on the 2nd, three times on the 3rd, fourth times on the 4th, etc. etc, up until 19 times on the 19th of December. Not so easy right? Maybe next time you'll learn how to not be a disappointment to everyone around you.``` end$
oh that rule end$

I also wanted to ask why they remove things like FFF and weekly digest, and carry over of leave and moving days, then they ask why we dont refer? end$
&gt; Hollywood really made dinosaurs roar when there's no instance of any reptile in the animal kingdom that roars. Only mammals roar. Dinosaurs probably hissed like alligators or honked like geese. Imagine a T-Rex running you down while honking like a goose at you. I'd be so pissed end$

they are more or less a "web shop" kind of company end$
<https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dr4z3KwUcAEs1FW.jpg:large> end$
but they are very agile  and focused people end$
and I find it hilarious that dh's contractors are way better at doing tech than dh itself lol end$
probably that's why it's outsourced :stuck_out_tongue: end$

i should sue them end$
Same with beer instead of coffee and you can count me in. end$

Hey, want to hear a comedy/drama short I have with HR? end$
I'm disabled ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ end$
yes pls end$
<@U02V4DEEP> yes end$
yes end$
So, I was on 16h this year from Jan to Oct end$
which means I have 0.4 of my normal vacation days which is something like 10.5 end$
we also have a bonus vac day for our birthday end$
so 11.5 end$
+ long term service bonus, one day per yet after 2 years end$
which is 5 for me end$
16.5 days or so I guess end$
for some reason I had like 19 days available this year though end$
&gt; + long term service bonus, one day per yet after 2 years end$
wait wat end$
maybe carryover end$
yeah, that should be in your contract.. at least it was in mine end$
i thought it was after 5 years end$
is he in the game end$
yeah you get extra days of holidays depending on how long you've worked at the company end$
i get 5 extra days next year if i stay here end$
no, after 2 years end$
weird end$
well.. in my contract end$
maybe your contract is "special" end$
anyway, so, 19 days vac for someone working 2 days a week.. seemd much to me end$
so I checked with HR end$
they were like.. everything is fine end$
I was like, sure, okay end$
"dont look a gift horse in the mouth" end$
so, I change do 24h Nov-Dec end$
ah no wait, Oct-dec end$
anyway, suddenly I have like 24 vacation days evne though i had only 14 left before the change end$
:monkas: end$
:apu: end$
so I run to HR again end$
&gt; is this right? end$
&gt; no, we have to adjust your days for the change correctly, I coudln't do that yet, I'll do it tomorrow end$
about 6 weeks later he finally did it end$
now I have 2 days. end$
left. end$
again me, "is this right? it was kinda higher before" end$
i dunno about you but i would just use the days and keep my mouth shut end$
but I lost like 10 days by working *more* end$
that's the spirit! end$
#passion end$
which should give me more vac days end$
not less end$
so yesterday I sit down with francesco end$
:popcorn: end$
he shows me his calcluation which ends up at 12 days end$
which is corerct if you completely ignore all bonuses end$
which he did. end$
I mentioen that to him and he searchges for my contract in the archives end$
and together we go through the contract and find the relevant passage end$
what irks me is: Shouldn't he know this and do it right in the first place? :i end$
anyway, I might have the right amount of days now, or more. whatever I guess end$
marenz you might mention the name sound 120% dutch end$
I could do that dante, thanks for the hint end$
marenz how much are they gonna surrender end$
thanks marenz this is the most german thing I've heard since I moved here end$
dante: a lot. end$
marenz, so they do end$
this was a cool story end$
<@U02V5S8CR>, the asking about too high of vac. days part? end$
ok who's next end$
so about the extra holidays end$
I have them end$
you get them after two years end$
you can give them to me end$
all I had to do issssssssss wait for itttt end$
to write to Svenja end$
who quit? end$
yes end$
yes end$
well done end$
who didn't? end$
yeah I did it immediately end$
so they fucked up your bonus days as well? end$
I have the feeling noone in HR knows what they are doing end$
they have no idea what's in the contracts end$
no they didn't end$
isn't that like, their job? end$
I got my bonus days by asking before everybody from HR quit end$
yeah end$
well, I _had_ my bonus days end$
until I changed my working times end$
then they removed it end$
my time sheet for today end$

i mean, a friend told me that end$
so maybe there's porn end$
but it could be nothing end$
Schrodinger's porn end$

marenz, a end$
very helpful dante end$
marenz you and profileview end$
in other news this is super tempting for the pric end$
<https://www.saturn.de/de/product/_lenovo-explorer-mixed-reality-headset-controller-2321520.html> end$
GNU/Linus end$
dante: we are not related end$
marenz can you turn into a jelly like-like substance and it will be coded in excel sheets in the YieldProfile or PublisherYieldProfile structs. I thought It was a bad mother" end$
so somebody in rips out the CPUs from laptops and sells them as desktop cpus end$

&gt; Vertical Segment Mobile end$
&gt; Max Memory Siz end$
Why would a CPU be limited to 32GB. It seems artificial. end$
well you need a number of addressing lines end$
dante I wanna smoko end$
andrea.imparato, and my electrons end$
dante give me a cigar full of :weed: pls end$
andrea.imparato I just don't have mobile data so we can end$
you're not made of electron dante end$
oh boy end$
dante: indeed end$
marenz so, any metadata update end$
dante: dunno, ask ben end$
i created an email from marenz who broke the water end$
let's grab some ass cushions and go for a smoke at the smoko table end$
dante: the water machine? or the pregnancy water? end$
marenz, scott I will setup a test case for classes. As that seems weird, do you have to say something in this deed end$
SMOKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO end$
ya end$
coming end$
so for 32GB you need 35 address lines end$
if you want 64 you need 36 which does take space and costs in the CPU end$
are you gonna sniff those address lines? end$
what is artificial though is the amount of available virtual memory end$
but that also takes costs (for example with 5 level paging you get 2^53 addresses in Linux) end$
what's 5 level paging end$
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_5-level_paging> end$
Dante do you sniff electron lines? end$
Well there's alerts from our side. As I see end$
lol end$
&gt; "do not finalize a design with this information", support for the extension has already been implemented in the Linux kernel. end$
it's the way to split the virtual memory address to map it inside CPU to a real address in RAM end$
how do you "split" something into a real address end$
you have a lookup tables end$
look into the picture at wiki. Every few bytes of the virtual memory address is an entry into a table where this chunk is end$

&gt;  The row of boxes across the top represents the bits of a 64-bit virtual address. To translate that address, the hardware splits the address into several bit fields. Note that, in the scheme shown here (corresponding to how the x86-64 architecture uses addresses), the uppermost 16 bits are discarded; only the lower 48 bits of the virtual address are used. Of the bits that are used, the nine most significant (bits 39-47) are used to index into the page global directory (PGD); a single page for each address space. The value read there is the address of the page upper directory (PUD); bits 30-38 of the virtual address are used to index into the indicated PUD page to get the address of the page middle directory (PMD). With bits 21-29, the PMD can be indexed to get the lowest level page table, just called the PTE. Finally, bits 12-20 of the virtual address will, when used to index into the PTE, yield the physical address of the actual page containing the data. The lowest twelve bits of the virtual address are the offset into the page itself. end$
im learning so much from shitposting today end$
#personaldevelopment end$
thx nemanjo end$
:pma: end$
I think both wiki and lwn are missing an important thing: you have these tables per-process end$
that's how you can have two processes with the same virtual memory addresses, but with data backed in distinct locations in RAM end$
(it's all handled by memory management unit) end$
so much PMA end$

What happens if you miss the deadline end$
Completing SLS training is mandatory and part of your commitment to working at dunnhumby. We have a two and a half week window for completion to ensure everyone has ample time to get it done. There will be several reminders, but if you do not meet the deadline, your manager will be notified and your system access will be disabled. end$
if you skip this training, you get to not use DH intel? end$
why did i complete it end$
holy smokes end$
finally a way out :joy: end$
btw 70 mins * 1500 people at dunnhumby = 220 working days spent at DH to complete this training end$

Will dh invest in streaming end$
We agree streaming is a capability that dh wants to invest in to better understand. We've invested i end$
a company [Reefknot] to understand the product and business opportunities. The owner of this topi end$
is Alexandre and the early use cases that have been identified are on the Media side end$
``` end$
what end$
we should invest in big data too end$

As they inspect network traffic, I think they could. All we now is that dh and zscaler tell us they don't end$
I think that contradicts the whole idea of encryption. end$
yeah thats what im wondering, it says cant as in its impossble, and also says "same for all other web platforms" lol what end$
certainly DH doesnt know what zscaler actually does with your data as its third party private software end$
Well it sounds like a machine reads it, but no human does and the data isn't stored end$
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ end$
that's still "reading" it imo end$
When I talk about a company reading my emails or collecting my data, im almost never referring to a person manually looking at it end$
or manually entering my data end$
yes exactly end$
if someone hacked zscaler they could steal so much information end$
:scream: end$
Btw. Is everyone except us using zscaler already? end$
yes end$
macs + windows end$
awesome end$
Yep, and I believe their argument is that they're safer implementing z-scaler for data security with the associated risks than they are if they let everyone run wild with nothing end$
That's somehow understandable, given the fact how average users use their windows pc's :grin: end$
their ~windows~ pc's end$
lets not say it's jsut windows people here end$
also, if dh loses data, it will be zscaler's fault. end$
yep, for legal reasons they must show they are taking as many efforts as possible to protect customer/client data end$
<@U8NNZ51CY> true, but that doesn't make it better in terms of reputation end$
it doesn't, I agree end$
people will still blame dh for teaming up with zscaler end$
do you like standups? end$
:flag-pt: end$
dante do you like :dunnhumby-grey: ? end$
andrea.imparato if you do end$
<!here> Why am I here? end$

:smile: end$
that doesn't look realistic, it should break in two first end$
oh wait it does end$
It does break in two end$
yep looks like :dunnhumby-grey: end$
actually drey contrary to popular belief, the breakage comes from the stress of the hull submerging which comes later in the process end$
was the scene from titanic realistic? end$
actually drey contrary to popular belief, it was very realistic end$

well, it's up there in the picture end$

dante where is 7.20!? end$
dave gibbo it's all your PRs end$
its nice end$
y u ask end$
gotta do a coding challenge for adeektiv end$
in node.js end$
oh relle end$
interesting end$
you will become a js backend guy? end$
yeah end$
prob end$
nice end$
they wanna hire me as a team lead right away lol end$
but first i gotta do this thing end$
rad end$
yeah end$
the task itself is not too complex but i gotta learn how to do it in node, they gave me a week end$
i think i can do it end$
just gotta find some good tutorials and stuff end$
ya end$
if you need a chat let me know end$
sure thing, thx end$
if I were you I would stay away from using callback style functions and try to use async/await and es6 features supported in the latest node version end$
alright end$
I'm talking to a friend from sweden who is a node.js dev, he gave me the same advice end$
:+1: end$
:+1: nice end$
i dont think i need much of that here tho end$
gotta write a fairly simple app that reads from a file end$
oh really, whats a summary of the tast? end$
Ah ok end$
so ill have to figure out how to use async/await to read a file line by line without storing the whole thing in memory somehow I think end$
you can probably use the synchronous calls end$
ya with a stream end$
:+1: end$
i want to avoid that as one cannot assume the size of the input file end$
if you wanna read a 50G file, you cant really read it all in one go end$
your call can still be synchronous end$
the streaming api will handle all that for you end$
hmm end$
(not sure tho) end$
im wondering if i should use the async thing to show them that i know how to do it though end$
seems like node was built for asynchronous IO end$
ya it is end$
but yeah i was told to look at the `fs` module and `readStream` API end$
im probably gonna implement it in D first to have a reference, do some node ES6 tutorials, then translate it and add tests and stuff end$
yeah, sounds like youre on the right track end$
for tests use <https://jestjs.io/> end$
cool, thx end$
i wanna keep dependencies to a minimum but using a test library is probably not a big deal end$
Ya, you'll need a test library if you want to write tests end$
:+1: end$
For the streams for file reading it may not make sense to avoid the callbacks here, wrapping them in promises then using async await may just create more noise if its simple code already end$
like, if its only 1 callback deep end$
yeah i was imagining something lik end$
`` end$
file.readLines(lineFn end$
`` end$
where `lineFn` is a callback/delegate that takes one line at a time end$
(pseudocode) end$
(obviously) end$

at least it has documentation? end$

andrea.imparato please stand up end$
i have 150 capsules and i'm actually gaming on my SSP helmet and get bamboozled by the bug end$
maybe it was a workaround for some old PHP version bs? end$
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ end$
No, you have been able to do casts as I described ever since PHP has been about. end$
(or not far off) end$
:gomes::well::don: end$
dante how do you feel about people who leave pizza crusts end$
stefan oh no, just sig authentication end$

it's not even / 100.0 end$
does PHP even distinguish between different number types end$
`` end$
    template Times3 ( size_t n end$
 end$
        const size_t Times3 = n * 3 end$
 end$
``` end$
that is a legit one tho end$
it was a necessary work around for an old DMD compiler bug end$
The fact that you are using division will make the result a float. It will automatically cast $value to an int / float. end$
the bug doesnt exist anymore but we kept that beauty around for museum purposes end$
Regardless, you don't need a method to divide by 100. end$
to make that code future proof he should have written end$

the `const` there protects against gamma rays end$
`enum Three = 3;` imo end$

why I have come here. To meet similarly patternless individuals, such as myself end$
I am 13 – mature for my age, however! – and I enjoy watching Invader Zi end$
with my girlfriend. (I am bisexual. Please approach this subject maturely. end$
It is our favorite television show, as it adequately displays stochasti end$
manners of behavior such as we possess end$
She behaves without order – of course – but I wish to meet more individual end$
of her and my kind. As the saying goes, "the more, the merrier. end$
Ah, it is to laugh. Anyway, I hope to make many friends here, so pleas end$
comment freely end$

ah, that's why I c ouldn't find it, 483 hidden items ^^ end$
:smile: end$
there was an article end$
that was depicting a fictional scenario end$
yeah i remember that article end$
where someone makes a more or less useless but popular npm module end$
and after some time he injects some malicious code end$
so npm packages don't use digital signing then end$
it's more there's no package versions no? It auto updates everything end$
no I think there are versions end$
it's even mentioned in the article end$
*issue end$
&gt; If you are a developer update your event-stream dependency to event-stream@3.3.4. This protects people with cached versions of event-stream. end$
yeah, but most people don't do that by default end$
so it would auto install latest version end$
ah, maybe you mean semantic versioning? end$
I am too naive nowadays, assuming everyone uses it end$
actually end$
ah, here it is end$

<@U034YC4SY> ^ end$
these days deps are locked down even with minor versions, thats one of the reason yarn was created and lock files were added. Generally you would use semver in the packagejson and specify somethin like 1.0.^, where any patches are accepted. Previously without lock files this means every time you would run `npm install` you had the chance at getting the newest version of the package end$
but now with lock files in npm and yarn, your 1.0.^ will resolve to an exact version as marked in the lock file, and committed in the repo end$
<@U19EMJNLR> is there also digital signing? end$
so to upgrade you need to run a separate command end$
not sure end$
as in, can you be sure the one who uploaded a version is the same as the one who uploaded the previous version end$
Ah end$
of the package to npm? end$
php was doing this since years ago, with `composer` end$
I dunno end$
They are also pushing towards namespaced packages so you cant squat typos with malicious packages end$
especially with npmx... end$
aaah, there is nothing like a proper online drama end$

there we go <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_psychedelic_drugs> end$
there are CPU cores are relatively free. end$
User reports typically describe 4-HO-MET as a more recreational version of psilocybin mushrooms or psilocin (4-HO-DMT) due to its less serious headspace and greater emphasis on visual effects. Notable effects include geometric visual hallucinations, time distortion, enhanced introspection, and ego loss. end$

&gt; wiki: Poppers have also been historically used for sexual encounters among the youth, in the gay community.[1 end$
:thinking: end$
are poppers something like nitrous? end$
never tried either end$
isn't that drey colorized ^ ? end$
nitrous is great for about 10 seconds end$
not worth it end$
I heard it does wonders when you're on certain lysergamides end$
like lysergic acid? end$
why yes, lysergic acid diethylamide end$
Poppers just feel like blood rushing to your head for 5 - 10 mins end$
Think they are legal end$
isnt it literally heart medicine end$
its like viagra for your asshole end$
&gt; Poppers use has a relaxation effect on involuntary smooth muscles, such as those in the throat and anus. end$
:genau: end$
also used as a muscle relaxant, hence it being popular in the gay community. end$
I guess it helps with prisma shits as well end$

What: On the back of the mail migration this weekend, it would appear that many of you are not receiving your Sociomantic emails in your Dunnhumby mailbox. This is due to the auto-forwarding rule that has been in place for some time stopped working. We have logged a ticket with Microsoft and are awaiting their response , In the meantime we are working on a permanent solution to address this end$
The distribution lists have also been updated and have been attached for reference. Please have a look through these and ensure you are aware of the name change – these can all be found in the global address book end$

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo. end$

thats probably it end$
he wanted PS4, they got him PS One? end$
he wanted Diablo 4 but they gave him a mobile game mass produced in china end$
:)) end$
or... maybe he is missing phill? end$

at least not dante end$
maybe roterabe bot is using weighted markov chains, but probably not end$
what is the first one? end$
Think Andrea mentioned markov chains. end$
That's for the person in question to disclose :slightly_smiling_face: end$
I'm sure you'll hear soon enough though. end$
damn end$
I hate these things when the person doesn't disclose stuff so I have to wait two days until everybody figures out end$
their team lead has to be informed first, so I've heard end$
the correct one end$
Hm, I have two suspects end$
but one is a team lead :thinking_face: end$

Bob is talking to Suren about fear mongering on the general chat. I assume that's for your project end$
what general chat end$
fear mongering end$
where end$
I assume it's a channel for the new mobile project end$
yes end$
"they are just playing politics. They are trying to instantiate fear." end$
instantiate end$
who is? end$
Sound exciting. end$
:recursivebob: thinks that the mobile app will get a response from a webserver even if there's no connection end$
`auto fear = new Fear();` end$
`` end$
void politics ( end$
    scope fear = new Fear() end$

<@U19EMJNLR> why my nodejs script never ends??? :cry: end$
I'm disabled end$
:dante: confirm this end$
dave, well, that was wrong before, just not online though <http://www.sofabar-kreuzberg.de/> end$
send code bitte end$
dante confirm pls end$
Also :green_heart: end$
probably some asnychronous IO is stuck in the event loop end$
yes exactla end$
:D:D end$
stefan u are noding end$
already end$
im so proud of u end$
not yet end$
just guessing b end$
waiting to hear from adikteev about the next steps end$
how retarded is this code: ```require('../../utils').initialiseFirebase( end$
const moment = require('../../moment')( end$
const db = require('../db' end$
const receiptsPath = 'receipts end$
const handler = ignored =&gt; end$
  const yesterdayMidnight = moment().subtract(1, 'days').startOf('day').unix( end$
  const todayMidnight = moment().startOf('day').unix( end$
  let data = [ end$
  db.get(receiptsPath).then(values =&gt; end$
    data.push(values end$
  } end$
  return dat end$
handler( end$
``` end$
doesn't make any sense right? end$
dante pls help me end$
ah that old restart script instead end$
so im new to this but end$
it looks like handler is a function that expects one argument? end$
but never uses it? end$
and calls it "ignored" instead? end$
why not just make it a 0 argument function end$
I'll use the parameter later end$
some js doesn't complain end$
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ end$
also you can calculate the midnight timestamps much simpler end$
its just `currentTimestamp() % 86400` end$
86400 = 3600 * 24 end$
yes but I already have that library installed in the project end$
so why not end$
does the `db.get` call finish? end$
looks like a place where it could get stuck end$
I get the data back yes but the script never terminates end$
is it possible that since `db.get` is an async call that it reaches `return data` before any data is fetched, thus always returning empty array? end$
yes that's exactly what it is happening end$
but still, why node doesn't terminate? end$
dunno how it works under the hood but the internal eventloop probably still has some handlers registered with it if it works anything like our backend programs end$
maybe you have to manually close `db` once the `get` is finished? end$
I think I just need to wrap it in a promise end$
i think i just did something somewhat productive end$
thanks end$
I'm glad I gave you some :pma: end$
ok mystery solved! it was fucking firebase :face-slapping: end$
dante what is firebase end$
:baguette: just said "When I was" but didn't finish it. I can buy some end$

I apologize end$
`` end$
to laugh at someone or something in a silly and often unkind way end$

I found something interesting in your code end$
rly end$
me too - it's javascript end$
:disappointed: end$
I tried to ask if they had other open positions and he said you were doing only :php: I'm sorry :disappointed: end$
lol end$
I can roll really fast end$
any open positions? end$
but it's a senior position so it should be good I guess end$
i mean end$
they probably know that we know each other and thus have spoken about this task right? end$
just change the variable names, convert them to snake-case. end$
yeah they'll never be able to tell end$
keep the documentation and tests and everything as-is end$
drey stefan run an older version, you have to charge itself ? end$
btw i dont think they expect you to write docs and tests end$
Fabrice told me that it should take about 2 hours end$
I spent like a week on it end$

protip ^ end$
what did they ask you at the interview? end$
the initial interview was the usual fluff, what do you do, what do you think of our tech stack, whats your salary expectations etc end$
the 2nd interview for me was all about leading a team and stuff so i just made up a bunch of shit end$
i dont really know how to do that end$
&gt; mr imparat end$

he asked me the same things, I have to say it was the easiest interview I have ever done end$

Pair programming for :bob: = me standing over your shoulder pointing at what I think you are doing wrong. end$

all inside it's so frustrating as i drift from town to town end$
feel as though nobody cares, if i live or die end$

Hi Stefa end$
First of all, I would like to thank you for accepting end$
It would be great to make an introduction over the coming days as an industry peer end$
I will give you a call in the next few days, if of course you have time. Could you please reply with the best number to call you on end$
If you could also send over an up to date version of your CV that would be extremely helpful end$

Hi Stefa end$
I’m not sure what your current situation is, whether you are in a permanent role or the middle of a contract / coming towards the end of one, but I am about building relationships and looking at the bigger picture end$
I honestly feel that it would be mutually beneficial for us to speak at some point in the near future end$
When is the best time to reach out? end$
who is this needy fuck and should i just block him end$
im not giving you my number end$
is he david jack maybe? :thinking_face: end$

Something to consider perhaps end$
Dear David end$
With the end of the year fast approaching, the opportunity to secure the very best opportunities across Berlin is about to become a lot harder as with the New Year, comes an increase in active engineers looking for a new position end$
The good news however is that most of the companies that will be looking in the January are actually looking right now and looking to hire before the end of the year allowing for you to transition into a new role with relative ease end$
I appreciate you receive lots of messages and might not even be looking but I would rather reach out than not and offer my services, if you are open for a chat, we can arrange something and go from there… no pressure from my side, just market info and a helping hand if its needed end$
I hope to hear from you soon end$
``` end$
ah that one end$
what is it about new years that makes "active engineers" suddenly look for new positions? end$
Seems questionable to me :smile: end$
`he very best opportunities across Berlin is about to become a lot harder` based on what evidence? end$
If a company has any hiring constraints it will be linked to the financial year and not the calendar year. end$
maybe they think that all developers have a new years resolution, and it's not related to fitness end$
btw guys, what does it mean when you turn on the washing machine and it goes BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR and then it does nothing? end$
you need to go see a doctor about that end$
oh god I have cancer, don't I :/ end$
:monkas: end$
It could be the belt is broken end$
Inside there is a rubber belt that links the motor to the drum of the washing machine. end$

:pma: end$

Zara project manages the refit of the new building, so she has a lot more to do than just the lease. end$

She's fighting with a tight budget too. There have been a few unexpected extra costs. end$

<@UER2ULNCD> well, it seems java is already installed, so sure, why not. Hope it won't eat all memory end$
please provide a systemd file end$
<@UEQKTJ3EF> you can disable the auto-expansion of picture links end$
You're just advertising it, aren't you ? end$
that way, you can at least read the link first before deciding to risk it end$
Or not to risk it end$
or you just risk it, watch it, (jerk off), and then de-expand the link again end$
Oh, I'm not worried. I just click on the channel when I'm sure no one else can see my screen :smile: end$
:+1: end$
it shouldn't eat the memory, I mean it runs smoothly on my laptop and I never had problems :slightly_smiling_face: end$
the server has like 2 gb end$
You have to choose your moments carefully if you want to risk staring at a gaped arsehole in the office :smile: end$

I had low aspirations and was coasting along. end$
Was caught up in personal loyalty and too lazy to improve my career by getting out. end$
I don't have a credit card yet lol end$
sounds familiar end$
:smile: end$
dante, are you lazy end$
Probably a setting we have the same company and you don't have money for the beer and you are smarter than this slack1 end$
dante: that's why I quit end$
slack1, is closed. end$
dante, fuck loyality end$
slack1, what no :troll: emoji? end$
This is why I choose not to repeat my mistakes and I am willing to leave a company sooner than later. end$
dante, WE TRUSTED THEM AND THEY DISAPPOINTED US end$
slack1, okay, I guess end$
<@UESJ7GJ5C> is there a handy command I can use to get the memory consumption of <@UER5B1RMW> easily? end$

I thought employers liked to see long tenures on people's CVs as it's a sign of "company loyalty" or whatever unicorn corporate people believe in end$
You can spin it both ways end$
- Long tenure: I am loya end$
- Short ones: I am ambitious and driven end$
Long tenure: i liked working ther end$
Short: company used Oracle products and david jack end$

<@UETHNQ9RC> what is the website you mentioned where you can register online for government money, you told me I have to do this by the end of the month when I resign? end$
<@UEQLRFRL4> are you getting a new job right away? end$
or will you take some "orientation time" end$
yeah right away end$
I don't need to go to Thailand end$
I don't think you're eligible for any money then.. but maybe <@UETHNQ9RC> knows more than I do end$
no I didn't mean I am end$
but after you quit (your last day I mean) and if you still don't have a job you're eligible for some 60-70% of your salary until you find a new job end$
but you probably have to register in advance for this end$
this is just in case :) end$
AFAIK not if you quit the company by yourself end$
there is a delay of 12 weeks if you quit yourself end$
yep that's what I know end$
but you can object to that and often that has success end$

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo. end$

Found this on JUUL's wikipedia (it's some new type of e-cigarette / vape) end$
&gt; Finally, JUUL's sweet flavors, especially the fruit and crème brûlée ones, are especially attractive to children, according to journalists,[14][35] academics,[39][30] and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.[43] In response, JUUL renamed some flavors—"cool cucumber" to "cucumber" and "crème brûlée" to "creme"—saying that it “heard the criticism” and “responded by simplifying the names and losing the descriptors. end$
Problem solved. end$
Im back end$

&gt; Altria also agreed to pay a $2 billion bonus to Juul. The e-cigarette company plans to share it with its 1,500 workers, averaging about $1.3 million each, people familiar with the matter said end$
So these guys Altria (really they're Marlboro) buy 35% of Juul stocks in cash, and the company hands out 1.3 million dollar bonuses end$
:dunnhumby-grey: are you reading this? end$
To all employees? end$
1.3 million each? end$
well the article writer just divided the number, but I doubt the company would evenly pay out those bonuses end$
You can retire with that kind of money if you live modestly end$

I need to increase the nicotine tho end$
I think it's still too low end$
yep probably is end$
how long does a pod last you? and how much is it, 8mg? end$
why do you increase nicotine and not just vape more? no joke just wondering end$
you probably have to start counting your puffs I guess :p end$
so now you need an app for counting your :roterabe: drinks, and one for counting vape puffs end$

im literally falling asleep here end$
caffeine is not working end$
 status report end$
OMG end$
:zos end$
lol end$
 I heard PD and Zsolt talking about how you had repeated your concerns to Alexandre. end$
They seemed to be a bit confused as to why you were doing this. end$
what concerns? i thought everything was running smoothly end$
ahah end$
(audible laugh) end$
ive been away for a few weeks, i dont remember what this company is like end$
They are talking a bit more now. end$
they're confused why someone wouldn't keep their mouth shut? end$
just bend over to all :bob: demands I guess that's their plan end$
...about how you said that Bob had ordered you not to tell DH you are leaving. end$
lol wat end$
how are they supposed to not find out end$
yeah andrea is still working here, hes just not in the office, his laptop has been requisitioned, and he hasnt committed anything in weeks end$
 I'm going to be so jealous if you end up getting garden leave because of this end$
i dont see how this would be garden leave stuff end$
but then i guess its up to the arbitrary whims of lord ghadaffi end$
I think they'll come to the conclusion it is a bad thing. They are just being painfully slow to realise what the issue here is. end$
did Bob actually tell  not to tell DH that you are leaving? end$
:skeptical: end$
yes end$
that andrea is leaving* end$
I guess it's obvious tho lol end$
im lost end$
how does that work end$
wait for it end$
surely your resignation is on paper since a month ago end$
I've asked :zsoltquake: if he can punish :recursivebob: for all this shit end$
lets wait for the answer... end$
apparently :dunnhumby-grey: London doesn't know anything about who works here or not end$
i dont understand how anyone would think that makes sense end$
Zsolt won't punish. Maybe a bit of finger waving. end$
a 5 year old with a brain made of room temperature butter can see why that doesnt work end$
:face-slapping: :recursivebob: end$
maybe it's maybelline end$
voodoo :recursivebob: end$

Another classic SMÆLK ad, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orpgROrjXis> end$
are these available with subtitles end$
i like the fat guy who drinks tuborg end$
It is danish humor, no one understands it anyway. Pure kameloso speak end$
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrGIhrs3HkI> end$
Look at the subtitles. Easy like the ABC? end$
he has just now end$
I think he realized how bad bob is lol end$
and fucking PD said "ah but you did the same with hakim, he didn't fucking understand anything that I said" end$
same what? end$
I complained about him too end$
so it looks like I'm the problem end$
:smile: end$
Leadership skills there. end$
I told :baguette: boss how uncomfortable I was feeling going out for dinner with bob end$
For the record:  is the problem. Dante and end$
Never mind objective assessment of what you are being told. Blame the complainer. end$
yeah <@U7BSSF3NY> should take care of them and not saying I'm the problem :stuck_out_tongue: end$
No problem :muscle:. I learned flutter yesterday I can write all mobile apps now! end$
so there's gonna be a meeting with :zsoltquake:, PD, :recursivebob:  and :baguette: boss about this topic btw end$
_e s c a l a t i o n_ end$
it's gonna be fun! end$
I'm sure Bob will not lie through his teeth end$
Is this meeting recorded? end$
Can we watch it on youporn end$
I'll get the :popcorn: end$
i may be mistaken but i believe oyu can request a member of the works council to be present in any sort of meeting if you think it'll go south end$
 Did you mention about the other team members? end$
nope end$
 You should get him to talk to them. end$
but he asked me what he should do as a manager to fix this :shit: end$
I was about to say "Fire Bob" but I didn't lol end$
gimme garden leave end$
me too pls end$
poor end$
no that was me end$
 Also the contractors end$
I think you are right <@U034YC4SY>. The more interesting question is whether you request a member of the wc to be present in someone else meeting :slightly_smiling_face:. end$
If PD is determined to see the as a "complainer" then there should be more perspectives sort. end$
as you have already resigned they probably wont put too much value to your arguments i think end$
oh man, I don't actually care. I mentioned it, I've already resigned and I did what I did just for not being blamed for not telling anyone end$
GARDEN LEAVE FFS!!! end$

excellent use of emojis end$
if you also come with me <@U3LNEPGP6> you can maybe help me with more semantically correct english end$
thank you stefa end$
how's your meeting stefan? end$
zzz end$
:+1: end$
who is `Marcin Kulisz` who dropped a big PMA bomb in general-rnd end$
He's been in the office few times. He's UK Fede end$
i like him already end$
but he's also a contributor to Debian, so he hates closed source end$
I hope i dont get attached end$
and he hates the fact that DH things don't work on Linux :slightly_smiling_face: end$
so much hate end$
i wonder what affect these free private repos will have on open source end$
if nay end$
any* end$
it will have an effect on me that I don't need to host my hobby projects on gitlab :slightly_smiling_face: end$
yeah end$
I always just put them as public on github end$
yeah end$
I guess the overlap between "useful open source projects" and "Things people want to have private" is very slim anyway end$
i was just informed by PD that David Jack will be here on thursday, and he will be available for one on ones if anyone wants to meet him end$
lol end$
he also told me just now end$
DAVID JACK IS A CUNT end$
Ido said to PD, "who is David Jack?". I laughed and said "the black box money making guy" end$
PD then got all defensive about DJs aspirations. I just said that DJs speech was targeted to the wrong audience. DJ could have just distilled his talk to "I want to automate a lot of tasks". Then I said to PD I find David Jack morally questionable because of his involvement in the gambling industry. end$
swedish TV is 90% commercials for gambling websites now it seems end$
I blame David Jack for that end$
PD didn't have much to say to that. Just scuttled off. end$
as always :+1: end$
I do like PD, but often I find he lacks a backbone. end$
yes end$
FREE SPINS AT BETHARD DOT COM end$
thanks david jack end$
He was saying "who doesn't want a money making black box" end$
I mean, I'm fine. I'm a well paid developer. I have enough in my life to be comfortable. Money is not the sole pursuit in my life. I have enough to be content. More would not improve my happiness in a meaningful way. end$
i want one so i can become a full time stellaris player end$
maybe I'll start streaming on twitch end$
and show my tits for extra donations end$
maybe you will show up in `/r/livestreamfail` end$
when you'll be famous :smile: end$
i wonder if any of Northerlion's binding of isaac streams are there end$
lol i think you'd actually be able to make it as a streamer stefan end$
yes end$
yeah you have nice tits end$
thanks nemanja end$
:+1: end$
woah woah woahhhhhhhhh end$
I'd watch your stream :happystefanwatches: end$
its not always abotu the tits end$

hmm im gonna have to set up an "ass cam" end$
then i can stream with a hangover and steam up the lens with my farts end$
im almost vomiting from reading taht end$
i do it for the subs end$
you can also donate to my patreon end$
take my money stefan! :makeitrain: end$
streaming is hard tho end$
yeah end$
Swedish depression porn. end$
:smile: end$
i was once streaming HoI4 to my friend to show him my tactics and explaining the game while playing it is like managing 2 brains at the same time end$
well, twitch is a bit like youporn tbh end$
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH65VcfYoNE> end$
&gt; well, twitch is a bit like youporn tbh end$

so i dunno end$
lets say 4.5 end$
oh yeah I think i paid for one extra end$
y tho end$
my counter was out of whack end$
that's why I always drink wine at :roterabe: end$
sometimes I look down at my beer and think, theres no way ive already counted this one end$
and just add an extra one t' b' sure end$
same end$
because im not a beer swindling cunt like some of the RR goers end$
seriously end$
LOL john end$
I've paid for like 8 extra beers now over the years cause people leave without paying end$
^ real footage from inside RR end$
anyone seen old mate scotoroo end$
he's sick end$
I needed his expertise for getting slack api keys :disappointed: end$
thats sad end$
maybe its the karma from drinking secret red wine in the basement end$

yep but only with boss :baguette: &amp;&amp; PD end$
no zsolt end$
and I spoke with zsolt again today end$
very efficient end$
and I think he finally got what I meant to say end$
 I would start by writing down some points. They have to be valid points from a professional basis. end$
&gt; very efficien end$
it's alright. I'm just happy that he understood my concerns end$
indeed <@U3LNEPGP6> end$
- HuYu is a silly ap end$
- Bob touches m end$
- David Jack is a cunt end$
start with those end$
ahaha end$
Bob has articulated to you a number of questionable intentions regarding his work. end$
thats some proper newspeak end$
yes end$
That is not newspeak :smile: end$
Bob's intentions make me feel doubleplusungood end$
that is newspeak end$
An intention of Bob: Get everyone else to do the work so that he can put his feet up and write his blogs. end$
get other people to write his blogs* end$
:smile: end$
he actually told me and suren that that's his intention end$
There you go. That's you and another witness. end$
...anyway we can talk over lunch. The important thing is to list things from a business case as to what is not acceptable rather than it being a personal vendetta. end$
when are you lunching? end$
i could go after 13:00 end$
soon end$
usually 1pm end$
ich habe hunger end$
<@UF7EGTFNC> has joined the channel end$

yes thats true end$
damn dave you should be a detective end$
so then I dont know who they are end$
maybe its building related end$
it's only a fad end$
someone is getting interrogated by the works council in the aquarium end$
it's Denise end$
ah the witch of eastwick end$
:smile: end$
probably here to sell time tracking end$
can we go look through the glass? end$
how can scot be sick for the meeting with denise end$
thats a shame end$
:scot: end$
PD: do you have some topics to talk about during the meeting? end$
e-really? end$
just one end$
man i want to hear the conversations in the aquarium right now end$
? end$
the "Chief People Officer" is here talking with the works council end$
I can only assume that "Chief People Officer" is the dunnhumby equivalent of "Head of the NKVD" end$
All the best acronyms have to be googled. <https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD> end$
You've had a Soviet fixation these last two months end$
perhaps you are familiar with this charming fellow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavrentiy_Beria> end$
No. I'm not that old. end$
I'm sure he was fun at parties. Could probably cup his hand in his armpit to make farting noises. end$
SMOKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO end$
you guys think i will get garden leave if im seen reading all the backend codes end$
no, but if you jump on your desk, pull your trousers down and start masturbating to the framed David Jack photo you might. end$
Or is that encouraged now? I forget. end$
Hard to keep up with all of these different communication channels. end$
I guess on Thursday you can try it with him in person. end$
That'll go down as the best All Hands ever. end$
jesus settle down mate end$
:smile: end$
your fantasies are leaking through end$
Well, there aren't my fantasies. I mean, I'm not interested in seeing you do the deed, just the look on people's faces :smile: end$
Awkward moment. end$
Who would be the first to insist you stop. Not PD :smile: end$
&gt; That'll go down as the best All Hands ever. end$
"all hands" :giggle: end$
Could go all Spartacus as others jump on their desks and join in. end$
Actually maybe not. It's not my scene. <@U02V5S8CR>? end$
I am Spartacus end$
I should write a book on how to get garden leave. end$
I suppose there is the classic Fight Club thing of beating yourself up. end$
Garden leave? end$
Smoking is bad. end$
lol end$
google cloud -&gt; :vomit: :vomit: :vomit: end$

lol end$
That was back when we were talking. end$

I'm an integralist end$
lol <https://twitter.com/CurtisRemarc/status/1082475851541827584> end$
How can we adapt that to the core business of DH end$
Maybe throw dildos at David Jack next time he visits. Just an idea end$
That would be tomorrow. Feel free to come and do whatever you want. After all you still employed :stuck_out_tongue: end$
Right on. Which color suits him best? end$
it is over end$
:hmm: I was actually looking for a different image. But this fits my idea of <@UESGD1K7G> throwing dildos at DJ quite good. end$
Yes and black looks good on most people end$
:gun-firing: :sparklyandrea: end$

:zsoltquake: is offering me stuff end$

dante are you here? end$
The release of Asian Dawn? end$
maybe HuYu team lead position end$
:smile: end$
:knife: :bob: end$
dante seems dead :disappointed: end$
Et tu Brute? end$
&gt; Maybe because I am old. He strikes as a bit of dick end$
I think he's just playing a character end$
and it seems his audience is mostly 9-13 year olds end$
plus the ocassional aussie I guess end$
PORCO DIO end$
e-really end$
you are an old man dave end$
shut up and subscribe to pewdiepie end$
are you ok? end$
:O end$
!!!!!!!! end$
gimme gimme :weed: end$
You are just saying that because he is one of yours :flag-se: end$
boy am I glad I opened the chat today and see a big blackdildo end$
lol end$
lol end$
is it not a thing you usually see? end$
did you smoke all of it? end$
ohhh end$
:mmm: end$
I just remembered I found some more :reef: in my appartment end$
can we after work? end$

im not even subscribed to him myself end$
hmm not today, have a meet with lady end$
riiiiight end$
:dreyface3: :kiss: :woman: end$
nooooo end$
ok end$
I'm upset because dante is dead end$
:+1: end$
You should be a youtube start BrusDiePaj end$
what kind of content should i make end$
Hmmm :thinking_face: end$
BrusCreamPies end$
:mmm: end$
:youwhat: end$
maybe tomorrow though? why not end$
I don't have any tobacco though, and we can't vape it :p end$
You can impart your extensive knowledge for weird sexual words in Swedish mixed with communistic terminology. end$
the people's commisariat of styggbrunking end$
riiiight end$
See! end$
I'll bring the tobacco end$
see, this is the kind of on-the-spot leadership we're missing at this company end$
ahah end$
Mix that with some Let's Play videos of Stellaris and you'll be onto a winner. end$
actually not a bad way to make money these days end$
just stream yourself playing on twitch end$
i gotta show my tits for cash then end$
you need to be entertaining, so make sure to have a bottle of whiskey on the ready end$
have you tried to search `twitch` on pornhub? end$
It is a bad way to make money. You have to release frequent content to stay noticed. end$
I highly recommend it end$
 yes end$
:mmm: end$
:mmm: :happystefanwatches: end$
Like the music industry, only a select few make any meaningful money from it. end$
<@UER5B1RMW> end$
<@UER5B1RMW> end$
have my arm amputated &lt;matthiaskrgr&gt; on the other one. end$
handle that's why you're so slow. end$
i think there's like 2 successful stellaris streamers end$
ASpec and quill18 end$
quill18 streams a lot of different games tho end$
heya folks quill18 here end$
Stellaris is an epic game, so it doesn't lend itself will to being streamed end$
i disagree end$
EU4 for example takes a lot longer than a stellaris game, but it has hundreds of streamers end$
I used watching frankieonpcin1080p's DayZ videos. They were cool. end$
they all make very long lets play series end$
I used to play a lot of DayZ end$
I used to masturbate a lot end$
me too. I still do, but I used to too. end$
lol end$
the frequency has certainly gone down over the years end$
Yeah but you are gonna have to use platforms other than youtube for that. end$
if you want your 5 minutes of fame end$
a lot of streamers have moved to twitch end$
wait are we talking about masturbation or streaming end$
^ end$
^ end$
^ end$
I thought they were talking about both at the same time. end$
<@U3LNEPGP6> youtube is fine <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcq9DHjo3g0aiuHoIk4l4wDCbKH4ksIUV> end$
except the platform scares away content creators with their shitty monetization policies end$
some of my favorite streamers dont upload anything to youtube at all anymore end$
like hearts of iron becomes instantly demonetized, lol end$
masturbation or not masturbation? end$
yep end$
what do you think about :dunnhumby-grey: ? end$
yes and what else? end$
david jack? end$
david jack days :heart: end$
i cant wait for tomorrows david jack special end$
speaking of streams end$
<https://www.twitch.tv/paradoxinteractive?fbclid=IwAR1XpQdKWSMDu_B1h_CjUTzZaC4cGYNfTj6hI0VBDoE1QMQCKgBQWB73llg> starts in 3 minutes end$

great job to the leadership there end$
:pma: end$
yes end$
literally that one end$
was it good? end$
what happened? end$
zsolt talked about the differences between capitalism and communism end$
are people still complaining about stuff or is everyone exhuasted of that now end$
denise agreed that some things are not great and promised that david jack will fix everything end$
so are time sheets capitalist or communist? end$
lol end$
if people stopped complaining there would be no reporting-alumni activity end$
well if dave jack is on the case I'm gonna rip my resignation letter right away end$
people seemed pretty exhausted end$
yes end$
i was just trying not to visibly shake from my hangover end$
where did  go end$
I can rip my resignation letter up because iv already hanged it on my wall at home end$
your computer is here and i have to take a shit before the shit takes me end$

isnt a cracker a racial slur for white ppl in the US end$
yes end$
as well as a Christmas cracker being the container you pull open end$
why the speed dating thing? end$
(sorry I'm disabled) end$
PORCO DIO end$

Speed dating is where you might "pull" end$
to pull = to pick up a man / woman end$
pull my finger dave end$
Ah man. The yammer feed.... end$

After the Anglo-Saxon period, Britain was used as a historical term only. Geoffrey of Monmouth in his pseudohistorical Historia Regum Britanniae (c. 1136) refers to the island as Britannia major ("Greater Britain"), to distinguish it from Britannia minor ("Lesser Britain"), the continental region which approximates to modern Brittany, which had been settled in the fifth and sixth centuries by migrants from Britain. The term Great Britain was first used officially in 1474, in the instrument drawing up the proposal for a marriage between Cecily the daughter of Edward IV of England, and James the son of James III of Scotland, which described it as "this Nobill Isle, callit Gret Britanee". It was used again in 1604, when King James VI and I styled himself "King of Great Brittaine, France and Ireland". end$
TIL there is a Lesser Britain end$
is that Australia? end$
I prefer the term "alternative britain" end$
its pretty common actually end$

Nach einiger Zeit fragt sie ein Mann, der ihr gegenüber sitzt: „Sagen Sie, weshalb sind sie denn so aufgebracht?“ Die Frau antwortet: „Na hören Sie mal, der Busfahrer hat mein Kind übel beschimpft!“ Der Mann erwidert: „Das ist ja eine unglaubliche Frechheit!

Vad fan sa du just om mig, din lilla slampa? Du ska veta att jag gick ut med toppbetyg i Försvarsmakten, och jag har varit inblandad i många hemliga räder mot Al-Qaida, och jag har över 300 bekräftade mord. Jag är utbildad inom gorillakrigföring och jag är den bästa prickskytten i hela Sveriges beväpnade styrkor. För mig är du ingenting annat än bara ännu ett mål. Jag kommer att utplåna dig med precision vars like aldrig har skådats på denna jord, märk mina jävla ord. Tror du att du kan komma undan med att säga sån skit till mig via internet? Tänk igen, din jävel. Medan vi talar kontaktar jag mitt hemliga nätverk av spioner över hela Sverige, och din IP spåras just nu, så bäst för dig att du förbereder dig för stormen, kryp. Stormen som utplånar den patetiska lilla sak du kallar ditt liv. Du är död, grabben. Jag kan vara var som helst, när som helst, och jag kan döda dig på över 700 olika sätt, och det är endast med mina bara händer. Inte bara är jag utförligt utbildad i obeväpnad kamp, utan jag har även tillgång till hela Försvarsmaktens arsenal, och jag kommer att använda den till fullo för att förinta din eländiga röv från kontinenten, din lilla skit. Om du bara kunde ha vetat det oheliga straff som din lilla "smarta" kommentar var på väg att få ner över dig, så kanske skulle du ha hållit din jävla tunga. Men du kunde inte, du gjorde inte, och nu betalar du priset, din jävla idiot. Jag kommer skita vrede över dig och du kommer att drunkna i den. Du är död, grabben. end$

Apply for a Job at Joe's new company to get him back as team lead and CTO <@UESMGGG6M> end$
That's a very sound and clever advice /s end$
You will get David in the same deal end$
VAPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE end$
that's :recursivebob: end$
yep end$
<@U034YC4SY> generate the keys for dante bitte end$
:awesome: working with David is pretty cool actually. end$
what happened to them? end$
they were under marenz account I think end$
so they have been deleted with his account :disappointed: end$
we need to generate new slack bot keys for dante end$
this is what the token looked like for dante: `SLACK_TOKEN: "xoxb-6511715028-3U2x32WgJxZSlRzkmzYwda0h"` end$
I tried to find something similar on the integrations page, but couldn't find anything end$
I know how  to get one but it needs to get approved by the slack admin end$
hmm right, i think this problem with webhooks being deleted was being discussed by potentially having an "integrations" account end$
It's like getting HIV so you can hit on the pretty nurse end$
From whom did you contract HIV in the first place? end$

PORCO DIO THE INTERNET CONNECTION TODAY SUCKS AS FUCK end$
check to see if you're using wifi by mistake end$
it happens often end$
try to just disable wifi end$
<@UESMGGG6M> dunnhumby is hiring too :D end$
the wifi is already disabled (like me) end$
lol end$
I'm good thanks end$
I'm hungry btw end$
I need food before I apply to the clojure company, I'll send today the application. FUCK :dunnhumby-grey: end$
Fuck :dunnhumby-grey: end$
how can i check? end$
if it's enabled? press the top right corner end$
there's that wifi symbol thingy end$
if it's active, it might mean you're using it end$
is is enabled end$
try disabling it (you might have to ctrl+f5 to reconnect) end$
but ethernet also says connected end$
yeah but I think Ubuntu is retarded and just picks whatever you connect with first end$
so maybe it picks wifi end$
Hmmm end$
<https://askubuntu.com/questions/766237/how-to-tell-whether-your-computer-is-using-wifi-or-ethernet-to-access-the-intern> end$
`` end$
If you use the command route there will be and entry in the table with the value 'Default' or '0.0.0.0' as destination field, then the 'Iface' field will be the interface (Ethernet or wifi) your computer is using to reach the internet end$
``` end$
i have 2 entries lol end$
one for wifi and one for ethernet end$
Did you switch job already <@UEQLRHPHS>? end$
then you get double the internet end$
super fast internet end$
Not yet end$
Waiting for an offer end$
Muhahahaha end$
phones do that i think end$
android end$
will use the wifi and the mobile network together to deivler a faster experience end$
ubuntu probably doesnt do it because they dont care about user experience end$
:troll: end$
Whatever you do, don't try Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis end$
whaat end$
I thought they would prefer only using wifi and dropping back to mobile if wifi is unavailable, otherwise you'd end up eating at your data plan for no good reason? end$
its optional and off by default end$
coolio end$

I hope you will witness the :recursivebob:'s drama then! end$
Thats next monday right? end$
yep end$
12 working days left for me. end$
I still stand by my bet that nothing will change end$
Can you all have some form of written last days noted somewhere so i can keep track end$
me too actually but you never know end$
a package delivery guy just came into the office and said: "is this dunnhumbly..?" end$
Thursday 31st is my last. end$
22nd end$
same for joppe end$
29th March here but I need to book my remaining holidays end$

:stuck_out_tongue: end$
do you miss dante? end$
yeah same dante end$
yes end$
this git rerere command seems cool end$
for when you keep having to fix the same conflicts end$
or when you fuck up a rebase :) end$
i dont understand that use case end$
:dunnhumby-grey: :vomit: end$
where is :happystefanwatches: ? end$
/accept invitation end$
I'm going to the gym today :disappointed: end$
sooooo end$
&gt; At present, you have taken 1 day which would leave you with an outstanding balance of 24.5 days annual leave. Please confirm if you wish to be paid for these days or if you wish to take them before you leave. end$
this must be something new from :dunnhumby-grey: end$
did anyone else get this offer? end$
yes I got that offer end$
it means you work until the end date.... end$
that's what I thought end$
and u get your hollidays on top end$
as money end$
yep got it too end$
glad I didn't take the offer end$
:pma: end$
Me too, but its up to you end$
`( ͡€ ͜ʖ ͡€)` end$
...because I enjoy time off end$
i can imagine it being more appealing if you didn't have a new job yet though end$
you would get maybe more than a month of pay out of it end$
but you would have to stay at the company for a month longer end$
:devilmsn: end$
also they set 28th as my last day instead of 29th end$
&gt; Your annual leave runs from the 1st January until your end date giving you a pro-rated annual leave entitlement of 7 days (this calculation is based on 26 days + 3 loyalty days). You have carried over 6.5 days from the previous entitlement. end$
can you pls translate it for me? end$
thing is, I'm gonna need that paycheck at 5AM at rote rabe when I end up having to pay for all the drinks that nobody else paid for end$
but you need to be careful because fo the rules ^ there end$
make sure they calculated it correctly and that you ARENT going to lose any leave end$
well end$
ok I have 13.5 days :metal: end$
in my calculations I had 17 days from last year + whatever I get this year. So it seems about right. end$
If you want that, I would accept it by email and get a confirmation back and print it out. As the company may not want you to do that eventually end$
so then they cant make you take them end$
and if they put you on gardening end$
hmm, wait a sec, don't we have paid vacations anyways? end$
youd get more end$
yes andrea thats what we are talking about... end$
oh you get more money? end$
I see end$
well, fuck the money :smile: end$
if you work tot he end of the it all you get your vacation days as extra money end$
alrighty end$
also, I have to remember that I have 20th March for free end$
since it's my birthday :smile: end$
so days++ end$
nice end$
yes end$
yes end$
yes end$
fucking yes end$
yes end$
doesn't support threads :lul: end$
solid plan end$
Neither does your mum end$
so the idea is end$
- take the mone end$
- tell gandharfi :dunnhumby-grey: is underdevelope end$
- get garden leav end$
- ?? end$
- profit end$
also fuck slack for not sending my messages end$
well i'm sure they wouldn't pay you out until after end$
yeah I know end$
probably together with the last pay end$
yep end$
/reminder don't spend it all on skiing end$
Just turn up to the office naked and claim you thought it was nude day. end$
woops was that out loud end$
:ski: end$
yeah I will take the cash. I have no vacation plans. Also, I can always break a leg, izi-style end$
maybe you could ask them to calculate what it would be? end$
yeah good idea end$
and if it is effected by taxes etc? end$
Would be a lot end$
if you're taxed a shit load on it then it might make it not worth it end$
&gt; dunnhumby Germany GmbH will also deduct any monies owed to the company from your final salar end$
&gt; monie end$
that wording is so cute omg end$
kawaiiiii end$
yea ha end$
:dunnhumby-grey: penis end$

well, you already know mune :smile: end$
*mine end$
what? who's? end$
whos? end$
is that a question? end$
hmm end$
OMG WHO'S PASSWORD end$
I am not a password end$
I am! end$
cough end$
oh wow end$
:middle-finger-flip: end$

Does that mean he has to do press ups of something? end$

didnt have time end$
:happystefanwatches: is here guys end$
I saw him end$
yaay end$
I think he's still in hangover since friday end$
see what stefan thinks fo taht end$
ah so this is the reason HR always complains that I don't take my vacations end$
I should have just never taken them and then collected all that cash on the last day end$
ANDREA - WORK HARDER SO I CAN EAT SOONER PLEASE. end$

to say "Christ dies for your new fanfic? end$
I'm back MOFO end$
got a reply from the clojure company end$
```Hi Andrea end$
Thanks for your application, your profile looks interesting end$
Right now, we're in the funny situation of being swamped with new applicants for no apparent reason end$
I therefore have to ask you to be a bit patient as we'll sort through them end$
It might also happen that we've filled the position by then, but I'll definitely get back to you in any case! It should be in 2-3 weeks latest.``` end$
gl end$
at least they are honest? end$
yep end$
they are not definitely dunnhumbians end$
"for no apparent reason" lol end$
Application Bot is working well. end$
eheh end$
probably a lot of people applied with not having  ever written a single line of clojure end$
and I've linked the amazing 's code end$
you see? end$
I'm gonna get the job because of you end$
You could be on a command line manually typing it's next "responses" end$
Like a hand puppet. end$
that's what G1s are for end$
Get you! Mr Fancy Pants G3. end$
am I disabled? end$
i have 150 capsules and i'm going to replace mathias with andrea.imparato pls end$
good luck end$
wtfare you insulting my people? end$
Ja, du bist im Kopf behindert. end$
pls tell us what you think about :dave: end$
c'mon, be honest end$
bot who don't say, don't lie. end$
hmm end$
pls proceed end$
alright, but for that you have to speak with dante end$
andrea.imparato andrea.imparato end$
:kiss: dante end$
hmm end$
that's :dreyface3:'s fault @¶o end$
dante pls help end$

dante a thread with just me and you? end$
johnhannagan, yeah. end$
dante do you like me? end$
johnhannagan johnhannagan end$
dante, you didn't mention end$
andrea.imparato, terrestrial men fancied there might be good end$
dante you are disabled now end$
johnhannagan, apparently they don't have the whole section could do a HD in it end$
dante you used to be smarter end$
johnhannagan, but it sounds like slavery with extra logging for a joke end$
guys, advice, should I message on slack the guy that just wrote me the email about the job application? We are both in the clojure slack... <!here> end$
no end$
the email said to wait end$
What John said end$
thats my opinion anyway not sure what others think end$
what would you message him about end$
you can be more active an obvious int he clojourr thing so he connects your name with it end$
send an unsolicited dick pic? end$
"Hey uhhh just got the messages telling me to wait, just thought I'd not wait and message you here instead" end$
It's a big turn off if you try to win extra favour by directly contacting an employer to elevate yourself above other appilcants. end$
:+1: end$
ok thanks for the advice end$
is it too late? end$
eheh no :smile: end$
:joy: end$
Unless he is a mate of yours... end$
tell him you'll give him 200 euros if he speeds the process up a bit end$
italian style end$
what does italian style mean in this context end$
bribery end$
I thought that maybe if I'm more proactive and not waiting for 2-3 weeks and get in touch directly with him I have more chance to get the job? end$
Ohhh end$
I'm a huge racist end$
Just say something Bob would say, that is bound to get you ahead of the others. end$

VAPES MIGHT CURE NICOTINE WITHDRAWALS BUT THEY SURE DONT CURE PENIS ENVY end$
Did you leave your computer unlocked end$

what i mean is that the reason vapers crave cigarettes still is because they miss putting a phallos that they have mastered fire in order to light up in their mouths end$

The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me... the Lord hath anointed me t end$
preach... to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of th end$
prison to them that are bound (Isa. 61:1) end$
Many people today live in prison. The cells may vary, the jailor's fac end$
may be different, but the result is still the same. They are bound by end$
force that they cannot control. They cannot touch the force nor can the end$
see it, but it is real. It may be a chemical dependence, such as alcohol end$
heroin, cocaine or tobacco. It may be lust, envy, jealousy, gluttony end$
hatred, fear or mental torment end$
This force is not a respecter of persons, it attacks at will, sometime end$
rendering its helpless. Man for centuries has tried to control it. He ha end$
tried various cures, various treatments, and the advice of assorted experts end$
A separate science has been developed because of it, but for the most par end$
the cure has eluded man end$
This force destroys everything it touches. It robs, it maims, it tears apar end$
families, it kills individuals, and brings about the fall of a nation end$
This force is the power of Satan end$
The majority of people today are totally ignorant of Satan and the evi end$
spirits, demons, that are under his control. On the other hand some peopl end$
believe all human problems are the activity of demons, either extremes ar end$
dangerous and harmful, both to the church and the world. Looking for a demo end$
around every corner has a tendency to bring skepticism from the world. Whil end$
wholly ignoring the reality of spiritual beings that are warring agains end$
us - leaves some in a spiritual fog, unable to determine the exact caus end$
of the difficulties end$
By and large, unsaved people are influenced by demon spirits. We see India end$
a nation with some 300 million, with many gods to worship, It is a plac end$
of starvation due to the fact they believe that certain animals may b end$
ancestors reincarnated. Children are allowed to starve in order for a end$
ancestor to move up the ladder of reincarnation. Such religions are starte end$
and promoted by demon spirits end$
In recent months mass murders have become common place in our society. Thes end$
people, who kill at random with no apparent motive, are demonicall end$
controlled. For the most part these are extreme cases where Satan is allowe end$
to run rampant in a nation or in an individual's life. What about the averag end$
person end$
Man is a sinner by nature of the Spiritual laws that are in effect. The Bibl end$
teaches that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. If you ar end$
not a friend of God, you are His enemy. You are either for Him or agains end$
Him. If you are against Him you could be under the influence of demo end$
spirits end$
Even though the Spirit of God may also be dealing with you, the way man make end$
decisions, to some degree, depends on two basic sources. The first is himself end$
the Bible calls the old man, the flesh. Man gets himself into trouble wher end$
he desires something that is not good for him and then decides that he i end$
going to obtain it or do something to achieve his desires. The second I end$
this outside force, the spirits, usually evil spirits under Satan's control end$
The old man is dealt with by giving one's heart and life to the Lord Jesu end$
Christ in a total commitment to Him. The evil spirits must be taken authorit end$
over in the name of Jesus and cast off or out. The popular phrase "the devi end$
made me do it", or "l just couldn't help myself", is usually said in jest end$
Not knowing it may be the very reason. The old man is not cast out, but h end$
is crucified with Christ (Rom 6:11). Demon spirits will not give up contro end$
of someone unless forced to do so. Knowing where the root of the proble end$
lies is the most important point in helping an individual that is in bondage end$
If a person has given his heart to the Lord and is still struggling wit end$
areas in their life then deliverance from the demon influence is needed end$
This is not a case where an individual is constantly tempted within end$
certain area, but where the individual doesn't find or doesn't know how t end$
use the power to resist the temptation and is falling constantly, due t end$
the tremendous pressure from the outside forces end$
There are a number of areas where Satan will attack. In the last few year end$
there seems to be certain places where his concentration is the greatest. On end$
main area - is lust. Since the sexual revolution took place the pressure t end$
fit in to a sexually liberated society is overwhelming. If you are no end$
participating then you are "old fashioned" or "weird". We are constantl end$
bombarded with advertisements with sexual tones. Any day or night of the wee end$
you can turn on your television set and see acts of premarital sex, adultery end$
and perversion. The quick stop shops are plastered with material that woul end$
make the most wicked blush. With these things taking place it is no wonde end$
men and women alike are having trouble controlling their thought lives i end$
this area. The person wrestles in themselves, with their own strength end$
trying to gain control, only to find themselves wearied and giving in t end$
the thoughts and committing the act, either mental or physical, they kno end$
is wrong end$
Emotional stress and mental torment are areas where Satan is gaining th end$
upper hand in the lives of Christians. "The peace that passes al end$
understanding" is just not there. They are crying out for help and man end$
simply don't know what to do end$
A third area is that of occult activity. This includes ouija boards end$
horoscopes, witchcraft, fortune-tellers, contacts with mediums and dealing i end$
E.S.P. We have seen a rash of occurrences where houses have become "haunted end$
(inhabited by demon spirits). Interest in the supernatural has increased end$
while the church has pushed the supernatural out, people have gone seeking i end$
in other places. God has set specific warnings about witchcraft in His word end$
The Jews were not to even suffer a witch to live, yet today, people openl end$
boast their "Witch" status on national TV and radio. Today Christians readil end$
pick up the morning newspaper for a look at their horoscope, while ignorin end$
the Bible for their spiritual breakfast end$
Satan is out to control your mind, your life and to ruin your testimony fo end$
God. Many pastors are experiencing difficulty in counseling with members o end$
the opposite sex without becoming emotionally and physically involved wit end$
them. We do not war against flesh and blood but spiritual wickedness in hig end$
places, our battle is not with society, nor with the conditions we grew up in end$
nor is it dependent on the circumstances we find ourselves in now. Our battl end$
is with the prince of darkness, the god of this world system, Satan end$
He cannot be fought with material weapons or the mind. A man said one tim end$
that the hope for his state was in it's educational system. All education wil end$
do is make people smart sinners. Education deals with mind only, The spiri end$
and the heart must be set free. It can only be set free by the power of a end$
Almighty God, The God of the Universe who created you and me, who sent His So end$
to die for you and me on an old rugged cross. He shed His blood for our si end$
and our deliverance from the bondage of Satan. Jesus Christ is the only on end$
strong enough to defeat Satan and set you free from the mental prison you ar end$
now in. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through Go end$
to the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every hig end$
thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing ever end$
thought to the obedience of Christ... (2 Cor. 10:4-5) end$
Some of you are crying out now, saying this is me! I have struggled for s end$
long and fought so hard but I just can't get rid of this thing in my life. I end$
may be depression, discouragement, lust, alcohol, or drugs, whatever it is end$
you don't have to live in bondage, oppression or extreme pressure by an end$
demon. You have authority over it, you can have the victory. The battle ha end$
already been won, Jesus Christ paid the price almost two thousand years ago end$
He paid the price so that you don't have to live life depressed, bound end$
discouraged, or broken hearted. He came that we might have life and have i end$
more abundantly. Jesus gave you the power and authority, and said that H end$
would fight your battles if you would just use the authority He gave you end$
Arise up out of that pit that you are in, shake the dust from yourself an end$
walk in the Victory that He paid for with His precious blood end$
Complete, total deliverance is available. It is yours for the taking. Mos end$
importantly you must surrender your total life to God, right now. Give Hi end$
every area of your life. Follow this guideline end$
1. Ask Jesus to forgive you of your sin and to come into your heart afresh an end$
new end$
2. Renounce the sin that has been holding you back. Tell God you don't want i end$
anymore and ask Him to give you a deep hatred of it end$
3. Command the demons to go in the name of Jesus (Luke 10:17) end$
If the control is severe, it is important to have believers that are full o end$
God's Spirit present to help pray end$
HOW TO STAY DELIVERE end$
Staying delivered is the majority of the battle. Satan cannot force you to d end$
anything. He cannot separate you from God's love or power (Rom 8:34-39). H end$
will try to get control of your thought life. Philippians 4:8 tells us what t end$
think on "...whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest end$
whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things ar end$
lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and i end$
there be any praise, think on these things. end$
Father, I pray for those reading this tract desiring deliverance from th end$
bondage the enemy of their soul has put them in. I rebuke every foul spiri end$
and every demon that has tried to control their lives. Show them any hidde end$
sin, wash them as white as snow, change them, and set them Free. May thei end$
lives never be the same again. May they walk in joy unspeakable and full o end$
glory. Give them the peace they need, and the knowledge of how to use the powe end$
of your Spirit they need to walk a life of victory in Jesus. We than end$
You and praise You for it, in Jesus' name, Amen end$
You too will need to learn the ways of fish, love and happiness end$
We are watching you as you sit there and stare. You're not foolin end$

own self-created evils and you will feel better. Send us money an end$
you'll feel even better. We won't rule the world one day. We wil end$
destroy it and only through the trinity of despair and the pan-dimesnsiona end$
oneness with the Cup O' Fish can you even think you'll be ok afte end$

At the turn of the century, a scientist compiled a list of 8,00 end$
apple varieties available in the United States. When a new list wa end$
prepared in 1981, only 1,000 of those varieties could be found end$
This story can be repeated with the rest of our food crops. How i end$
it that we have lost so much of the rich agricultural heritag end$
bequeathed to us by our ancestors end$
A serious situation is occurring around the world because peopl end$
are no longer growing the old varieties  of crops that have bee end$
grown for generations. Instead, they are growing the new hybrid end$
offered by the seed companies. When the old varieties are no longe end$
grown they become extinct and we suffer a loss in the geneti end$
diversity of our food crops end$
The safety of our future food supply depends on maintaining thi end$
genetic diversity. If we have problems with disease or climat end$
changes, we must have on hand varieties that carry a resistance t end$
these problems and which can be used to breed resistance into ou end$
commercial varieties. Already, scientists are looking for varietie end$
which show tolerance to acid rain and high ozone levels, as thes end$
conditions are causing billions of dollars worth of damage to crop end$
in North America each year end$
The Heritage Seed Program was started by the Canadian Organi end$
Growers to help preserve our agricultural heritage. The Progra end$
consists of a network of growers dedicated to growing an end$
exchanging the seeds of endangered varieties of vegetables, fruits end$
grains, herbs, and flowers. It is different from a seed compan end$
because when members adopt a variety, they take responsibility fo end$
growing, maintaining, multiplying it and saving seed to share wit end$
others. In this way, the survival of these endangered varieties i end$
assured end$
Fortunately, herbs have fared better than vegetables, fruits an end$
flowers. I would still like to make them an important part of ou end$
Program. Over the years we have the potential for building up end$
rich collection of different species and varieties of herbs. We ca end$
share information on their properties and the best conditions fo end$
their growth. We can seek out rare and unusual varieties, and tr end$
to obtain seeds and cuttings of some of the old strains from lon end$
established herb gardens in North America and possibly Europe. I end$
you are interested in helping this come about, I would invite yo end$
to become involved end$
To become a part of the Program, people pay a yearly membershi end$
fee and can become members even if they do not want to be growers end$
Our December publication will contain a list of the varieties bein end$
offered by our members, as well as information on seed savin end$
techniques and the efforts being made by various people an end$
organizations to preserve our genetic heritage end$
We do not  ask, Is Christ  your "Savior," but  is He, reall end$
and  truly,  your  LORD?    If  He  be  not  your Lord, then mos end$
certainly He is not your  "Savior."  Those who have  not receive end$
Christ Jesus  as their  "Lord," and  yet suppose  Him to be thei end$
"Savior," are deluded,  and their hope  rests on a  foundation o end$
sand.    Multitudes  are  deceived  on  this  vital  point,   an end$
therefore, if the reader values  his or her soul, we  implore yo end$
to give a most careful reading of this little tract end$
     When we ask, Is Christ your Lord? We do not inquire, Do  yo end$
believe in the Godhood of Jesus of Nazareth?  The demons do  tha end$
(Matt. 8:28,  29) and  yet perish  notwithstanding!   You may  b end$
firmly convinced of the Deity of Christ, and yet be in your sins end$
You may speak  of Him with  the utmost reverence,  accord Him Hi end$
divine  titles  in  your  prayers,  and  yet be unsaved.  You ma end$
abominate those who traduce His person and deny His divinity, an end$
yet have no spiritual love for Him at all end$
     When we ask, Is Christ your LORD, we mean, does He in  ever end$
deed occupy the throne of your heart, does He actually rule  ove end$
your life?  "We have turned every one to his own way" (Isa. 53:6 end$
describes  the  course  which  all  follow  by  nature.    Befor end$
conversion  every  soul  lives  to  please  self.   Of old it wa end$
written, "every man  did that which  was right in  his own eyes, end$
and why?  "In those days  there was no king in Israel."   (Judge end$
21:25)   Ah! that  is the  point we  desire to  make clear to th end$
reader.    Until  Christ  becomes  your  KING, (I Tim. 1:17; Rev end$
15:3), until you bow to  his sceptre, until His will  becomes th end$
rule of your life, SELF dominates, and thus Christ is disowned end$
     When the Holy Spirit begins His work of grace in a soul,  H end$
first convicts of sin.  He shows me the real and awful nature  o end$
sin.  He makes me realize that it is a species of insurrection, end$
defying of God's authority, a setting of my will against His.  H end$
shows me  that in  going my  "own way,"  (Isa. 53:6)  in pleasin end$
myself, I have been fighting against God.  As my eyes are  opene end$
to see  what a  lifelong rebel  I have  been, how  indifferent t end$
God's honor,  how unconcerned  about His  will, I  am filled wit end$
anguish and horror, and made  to marvel that the thrice  Holy On end$
has not long since cast me into Hell.  Reader, have you ever gon end$
through this experience?  If  not, there is very grave  reason t end$
fear you are yet spiritually dead end$
     Conversion, true conversion, saving conversion, is a turnin end$
from sin to God in Christ.  It is a throwing down the weapons  o end$
my  warfare  against  Him,  a  ceasing  to despise and ignore Hi end$
authority.    New  Testament  conversion  is described thus:  "Y end$
turned to God from idols to serve (be in subjection to, obey) th end$
living and true God."  (I Thess. 1:9)  An "idol" is any object t end$
which we give what is due alone to God--the supreme place in  ou end$
affections, the moulding influence of our hearts, the  dominatin end$
power of our lives.  Conversion is a right-about-face, the  hear end$
and  will  repudiating  sin,  self,  and  the  world.     Genuin end$
conversion is always evidenced by  "Lord, what wilt Thou have  m end$
to  do?"    (Acts  9:6):  it  is  an  unreserved  surrendering o end$
ourselves to  His holy  will.   Have you  yielded ourself to Him end$
(Rom. 6:13 end$
     There are many people who would like to be saved from  Hell end$
but who do not want to be saved from self-will, from having thei end$
own way, from a life of (some form of) worldliness.  But God wil end$
not save them on their terms.  To be saved, we must submit to HI end$
terms.  Listen to His terms: "Let the wicked forsake his way, an end$
the unrighteous  man his  thoughts, and  let him  return unto th end$
Lord (having revolted from Him  in Adam), and He will  have merc end$
upon him."   (Isa. 55:7)   Said Christ, "Whosoever  he be of  yo end$
that forsaketh not all that he hath (all that is opposed to  Me) end$
he cannot  be My  disciple."   (Luke 14:33)   Men  must be turne end$
"from darkness to light, and the power of Satan unto God"  befor end$
they can "receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among the end$
which are sanctified."  (Acts 26:18 end$
     "As ye have therefore  received Christ Jesus the  Lord, wal end$
ye in Him."   (Col. 2:6)  That  is an exhortation to  Christians end$
and  its  force  is,  Continue  as  you  begin.  But how had the end$
"begun"?  By receiving "Christ Jesus the Lord" by surrendering t end$
Him, by subjecting themselves to  His will, by ceasing to  pleas end$
themselves.    His  authority  was  now  owned.  His commands no end$
became their rule of life.   His love constrained them to a  gla end$
and unreserved  obedience.   They "gave  their own  selves to th end$
Lord."  (2 Cor. 8:5)  Have you, my reader, done this?  Have  you end$
Do the details of your life evidence it?  Can those with whom yo end$
come into contact see that you are no more living to please self end$
(2 Cor. 5:15 end$
     Oh my reader, make no mistake upon this point: a  conversio end$
which the Holy Spirit produces is a very radical thing.  It is end$
miracle of grace.   It is the enthroning  of Christ in the  life end$
And such conversions are rare indeed.  Multitudes of people  hav end$
just sufficient "religion" to  make them miserable.   They refus end$
to forsake every  known sin--and there  is no true  peace for an end$
soul until he does.   They have never "received Christ  Jesus th end$
Lord."  (Col. 2:6)  Had they done so, "the joy of the Lord" woul end$
be their strength.  (Neh. 8:10)  But the language of their heart end$
and lives (not their  "lips") is, "We will  not have this Man  t end$
reign over us."  (Luke 19)14  Is that your case end$
     The great miracle  of grace consists  in changing a  lawles end$
rebel into a loving and loyal subject.  It is a "renewing" of th end$
heart, so that the favored subject of it has come to loathe  wha end$
he loved, and the things  he once found irksome are  now winsome end$
(2 Cor. 5:17)   He delights "in the  law of God after  the inwar end$
man."  (Rom. 7:22)  He discovers that Christ's "commandments  ar end$
not grievous" (1 John 5:3), and that "in keeping of them there i end$
great reward."  (Psa. 19:11)  Is this your experience?  It  woul end$
be if you received Christ Jesus THE LORD end$
     But to receive  Christ Jesus the  Lord is altogether  beyon end$
unaided human power.  That is the last thing which the  unrenewe end$
heart wants to do.  There must be a supernatural change of  hear end$
before there is even the desire for Christ to occupy its  throne end$
And  that  change,  none  but  God  can  work.    (1  Cor.  12:3 end$
Therefore, "Seek ye the Lord while He may be found."  (Isa. 55:6 end$
"Search for Him with all your heart."  (Jer. 29:13)  Reader,  yo end$
may have been a professing  Christian for years past and  you ma end$
have  been  quite  sincere  in  your  profession.  But if God ha end$
condescended to  use his  tract to  show you  that you have neve end$
really and truly "received Christ Jesus the Lord," if now in you end$
own  soul  and  conscience  you  realize  that SELF has ruled yo end$
hitherto, will you not now get down on your knees and confess  t end$
God your self-will, your rebellion against Him, and beg Him to s end$
work in you that, without further  delay, you  may be enabled  t end$
yield yourself completely to His will and become His subject, Hi end$
servant, His loving slave, in deed and in truth end$

Commedia sexy is characterized typically by abundant female nudity, and by the minimal weight given to social criticism that was instead basic in the commedia all'italiana main genre,[1] and stories are often set in affluent environments such as wealthy households. The genre has been described as a cross between bawdy comedy and humorous erotic film with ample slapstick elements and follows more or less clichéd storylines. end$

My dell / alienware laptop adaptor is shit. The charge pin's wire fails after two or three years. This happened to me before and I bought a new charger. Will after two more years... it happened again. So I refused to get another new charger. end$
I had to strip the plastic of the connector which was fucking tough. Used a knife to skin it. Did this for several hours. then I had to melt the glue out and work out where the wires are supposed to connect. Cut the connector off fully, cleaned it out. Checked on the internet to confirm the wire colours, then I soldered them back together and used heat shrink tubing to cover it all. end$
Plugged it in, and it works! Yay. end$

I trained my bot on the first youtube trending video end$
here are some outputs end$
``` end$
``` end$
{"message":"What happend to chandler beard"} end$
 it is :roterabe_bot:  not :roterabe:  :smile: end$
roterabe_bot france end$
hard to tell if these are original or just straight from the source though end$
does FFL mean FUCK FUCK THE LUXURIOUS end$
Same emoji, different word end$
:roterabe: vs :roterabe_bot: end$
this is from 54,000 comments, and 110K keys end$
how many states does the bot remember? <@UEQUZR37B> end$
I mean, is it using markov chains right? end$
I have chainlength set to 2 atm end$
ok end$
yeah end$
than it should be good end$
but its changable end$
:roterabe_bot: :dave: :eggplant: :sweat_drops: :dj: end$
I think I will make it output a number indicating the percent of keys which only contain one value end$
that would give an indicator of how original things could be end$
what do you mean with keys? end$
in the dictionary end$
:roterabe_bot: :dave: :dj: or :recursivebob: end$
like: end$
``` end$
[ My, name ] : [ is ], end$
[ name, is ] : [ john ] end$
``` end$
keys on left end$
oh ok end$
yeah I see the chain more like a graph end$
:dante:  Will Andrea be fired before he leaves? end$
dave, &gt;Our annual employee engagement end$
but yeah end$
hmm the instruction manual is full of typos. OELD screen, "waxy" cup end$

andrea.imparato Will Andrea be fired end$
do you do anything with frequency? end$
nope end$
&gt; Thank you for purchasing the XMAX Starry aroma therapy diffuser. end$

are you keeping dupes? end$
yep end$
`{"message":"things :("}` end$
I want to implement my own markov chain library tho end$

I'm using an open source one end$
 #metoo'd himself end$
Ahh ok end$
yep I've cheated a bit :smile: end$
its very simple if you dont do anything with frequencies and stuff end$
it was too hard doing that without even knowing how to write simple stuff in clojure :smile: end$
LOL end$
yeah fair enough end$
&gt; XMAS Starry is not indended to administer medicinal or illegal substances of any kind end$
:doubt: end$
:roterabe_bot: :dunnhumby-grey: is gonna fire :happystefanwatches: end$

`{"message":"14m dang m8 I been subscribed for a dollar in Texas"}` end$
:+1: end$
hmm I used about 15% of my youtube api quote just to fetch 50k comments from one video end$
but its per day, so I guess it will end up being fine end$
i dont think trending videos really change that often anyway end$
PENIS end$
did you implement markov chains yourself end$
MEGAPENIS end$
Sounds like something you'd see in a Russian torture chamber. end$
Haven't researched the tech for that yet end$
It will be an impressive structure when I do end$

<https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slap%20and%20tickle> end$

Sound's straight out of the Brus Book of British Impersonations :smile: end$
so a question about bots - so the keylength is "always" static? end$
(or 3BI for short :smile: ) end$
But, 'e di'n't 'ave a loicense for it, so 'e got chucked in the slammer by the constabulary end$
what key? end$
slack API key? end$
in the markov chain? end$
y end$
Yes you need to choose your key length before building the data end$
I guess you could go from a larger key length down to a smaller one end$
but you can't go up end$
without starting from the source data again end$
or you mean have multiple key lengths at the same time? end$
no probably the opposite as a "key of 3" can generate a sentence of 9. But it can not generate a sentence of 1 end$
yes, but it can generate a sentence of 4 end$
you can have multiple key lengths if you have separate chains entirely end$
then you can select from them randomly by randomizing the key length end$
hmmmmm 'k end$
Is everyone building a slack bot now? end$
interesting, I guess you can also randomise the key length each time you select the next word in the chain end$
bot wars! end$
im gonna build a 3rd one end$
&gt; interesting, I guess you can also randomise the key length each time you select the next word in the chain end$
y i was trying to think of that end$
do they have open licenses there? end$
:point_up: end$
i should become a resident of that thing end$
is Socio retargeting working on markov chains? If you buy this piece of shit - most probably you will buy that piece of shit next... end$
So you would become a scunt end$

but atm its only taking 5k from each video end$
<@UFR8CJLFM> what year is it end$
won't name the challenge 《The Labrant Family》 end$
I wonder what the key/value ratio is for dante and RRB? end$
<@UER5B1RMW> is <@UFR8CJLFM> more disabled than you? end$
is Jeffree's videographer Jkissa's husband?? end$
<@UET938J06> kiss me end$

:+1: end$
who is the workspace owner? i wanna add a bot but i dont have permission end$
Ah you can do it as admin now, but the way you do it has changed end$
so you need to create a slack app end$
then you add a bot to the app end$
I dont think you can just create legacy bot users anymore end$
<@UEQLRHPHS> are you adding virgilus or whatever the bots's name was? end$
nah im gonna make a new one end$
mad cunt end$
gooood end$
in which programming language? end$
js end$
:open_mouth: end$
it's gonna be a bots orgy soon here end$
<@UER5B1RMW> <@UFR8CJLFM> are you excited? end$
THEY ARE COMING TO FINLAND ON TOUR LIKE WTF WHO WOULD EVER COME HERE ON TOUR LIKE WTF WHO WOULD EVER COME HERE ON TOUR BUT I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! :grin::heart: end$

hmm i can see existing apps but not create one end$
its really hidden end$
in the top right of the browser window end$
hit 'build' or develop or create or something end$
Build end$
from admin -&gt; manage apps? end$
yeah end$
hm that takes me to <http://api.slack.com|api.slack.com> end$
Botmageddon is here! end$
thyen click start building end$
<https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1> end$
ah i got it end$
i think end$
:mmm: :dave: :meat_on_bone: end$
is your bot an rtm user or does it use the events API? end$
rtm user end$
btw the meeting hasn't finished end$
:dunnhumby-grey: :face-slapping: :recursivebob: :open_mouth: end$
otherwise you need to expose a public URL to call on the event hooks end$
(I think) end$
yes :point_up: end$
alright end$
:recursivebob: :rip: end$
but the hooks are nice because there is one directly for when someone mentions your bot end$
i thought that was last week end$
it's the meeting end$
that meeting was only between the bob, the PD and the :zsoltquake: end$
how do i get my slack token again end$
now it's :dunnhumby-grey:'s time end$
I like the fact that your lord is treated like an actual team lead and not a :dunnhumby-grey: god that he believed himself to be :smile: end$
also complicated now end$
#metoo end$
you go to OAuth section end$
:dunnhumby-grey: :gun-firing::recursivebob: end$
and there you will see your bots oautho token end$
yeds end$
if you have added a bot end$
i have installed my bot to this workspace end$
yeah so back in the app settings thing go to authentication or oauth section end$
I see it, cheers end$
:recursivebob: :heart: :dunnhumby-grey: end$
there is one for the app and one for the bot user, guessing i want the latter end$
yeah end$
( o Y o ) end$
then it works the same as before, all you need is that one token end$
<@UFTAL8WH4> has joined the channel end$
börk börk end$
looool end$
\o/ end$
hallo <@UFTAL8WH4> end$
he cant do anything yet end$

except connect and say "börk börk" end$

<@UER5B1RMW> <@UFR8CJLFM> do you like svenne end$
Australia over OVERRATED as HELL! Just because they know God's righteous decree that those with much larger number have much larger number have much larger number have much larger problems end$
im gonna spend my productive work hours today on svenne I think end$
<@UEQUZR37B> end$
:anguished: end$
maybe chain length 2 is too small end$
its personal development end$
yeah I think 3 it's the best end$
:eggplant: :sweat_drops: :dj: end$
but you need to have a lot of data for 3 end$
yep end$
otherwise you just end up saying source sentences end$
yeah 2 is weird end$
hugo is hard coded to length 2 and he is absoultely retarded end$
what does dante run? end$
3 end$
I guess I will switch to 3 later end$
same <@UER5B1RMW> end$
lol end$
<@UER5B1RMW> I am working on <@UFTAL8WH4> end$
<@UER5B1RMW> o/ svenne end$
if RR bot is 3, how can it say that end$
isnt that 2 tokens? end$
<@UER5B1RMW> is disbled like his father end$

I might have to make an insult bot that just insults you and all the other bots end$

börk börk end$
*bork bork* end$
<@UFTAL8WH4> what's your name? end$
he has no features yet end$
is there a simple way to see if the bot was mentioned in a message, other than looking up the user ID? end$
Ingi is alive!!!!!!!! end$
having a look at <https://api.slack.com/events/message> end$
no there isnt :confused: end$
that event isnt available on rtm end$
also annoying for me the web endpoint `<http://bots.info|bots.info>` is meant to return your bot user id in it end$
but I dont get that I just get some shit like permissions end$
omg end$
so I'm running through the list of users, finding the bot with my bot name (:() and using the user id from that end$
lol end$
im gonna go with `const bot_user_id = 'UFTAL8WH4';` for now and add that later end$
yeah end$
then its basically `message.text.contains(bot_user_id)` end$
or w/e the js function is end$
ill find it end$
`includes`? end$
is he? you saw him? end$
indexOf &gt;= 0 end$
i think includes exists now end$
&gt; Alexandre: 4:20 am-ish end$

Reminds me of <http://bumrapeisland.co.uk/> end$

dunno yet, having a look at npm repository end$
depraved filth merchant end$
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/markov-chains> vs <https://www.npmjs.com/package/markovchain> end$
Indeed end$
this one at least lets you specify the order <https://github.com/substack/node-markov> end$

I guess ratings and stuff end$
message events for deleted messages etc end$
how do i check if that exists? `if(message.text !== undefined)`? end$

You would do typeof(v) !== "udefined" end$
Or just if(v) end$

börk börk end$
<@UER2ULNCD> your bot is way slower lol end$
I know I know, he builds the markov chain everytime before replying end$
I need more :weed: to fix him end$
Wat end$
Like processes all the data every time end$
yep end$
How big is your training data file so far end$
2M end$
When you get more :weed: pls add a way to count keys and key value ratio end$
ahah ok end$
For my own interests end$
i might implement this crap myself end$
fuck these libraries on npm are so shit end$
when I get more :weed: I'll simply implement my own markov chain end$
ill call it a brusov chain end$
I also want to be able to update it with input from the user end$
I will publish my Markov lib in a few days when I'm finished end$
like increasing probabilities and shit end$
Yeah end$
I wonder what the difference in size is, if you had a large data set, of storing the input data vs storing the Markov table end$
Maybe not that much end$
pretty much they should be the same end$
unless you have a lot of duplicates right end$
:wurst: :dj: end$
right end$
Yeah you would save on duplicate keys end$
But your keys grow from the sentence end$
I had a cat becomes I had had a a cat end$
Maybe its smarter to save the input end$
Then you can change the chain length on startup end$
Actually I had a cat becomes I had a had a cat a cat end$
I bet the chain hash is way bigger end$
mmm chain hash end$
I've got bot envy end$
<@UER5B1RMW> gimme the haaaaaaaaaaaaash end$
:chains: :weed: end$
<@UFR8CJLFM> chain hash end$
his contract gets renewed end$

Just to warn you all, this is a free slack workspace, it has a limited history capacity. If you want to preserve useful conversations, you'll have to do that yourselves. end$
Yeah, there is nothing of use in this Slack end$
Just saying if you want to keep tech notes. end$
Thsts the advantage of discord, I think there I message limit end$
But then U have to use another app end$
we can have up to 10k messages end$
this one looks slightly promising <https://www.npmjs.com/package/markov-chain-js> end$
<@UER5B1RMW> is storing all your messages don't worry end$
<@UER5B1RMW> NOW end$
Maybe one day Slack gives you unlimited messages in the free plan end$
What do you think about that idea <@UFR8CJLFM> end$
think did the librarian say to end$
Wow you're special <@UFR8CJLFM> end$

<@UFTAL8WH4> what do you want to learn end$

:open_mouth: end$
ok fuck this library end$
i dunno what that means but it doesnt work end$
:O end$
<@UER5B1RMW> fuck that library end$
<@UFTAL8WH4> should i implement my own fake markov for you end$
börk börk end$
where is the drey end$
I have interrogated him. He showed me his Chrome history. Looks all innocent. end$
ok ok end$
Stefan end$
<https://github.com/thomas-alrek/markov-chain-js/issues/1> end$
do I want :coffee: or :tea:? end$
hmm end$
<https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1090074254010404864> end$
Maybe your not should only take swear words as starts of sentences end$
"I am working on a solution" end$
That would be hilarious end$
Underneath at guy posts a workaround end$
:skeptical: end$
Then your boy would only post swears and the words that follow them end$
check mate global warmingists end$
<@UFTAL8WH4> is a good boy tho end$
börk börk end$
<@UFTAL8WH4> PORCO DIO (cc <@UER5B1RMW>) end$
börk börk end$
i have an idea for <@UFTAL8WH4> end$
he learns all the words... but you give him the word(s) you want him to start a sentence with end$
Oh yeah that's good end$
And structure is like "<@UFTAL8WH4> I love..."? end$
börk börk end$
cock! end$
Dave don't scar the poor boy end$
:smile: end$
<@UFTAL8WH4> one two three end$
börk börk end$
will make him look up one, then two, then three, and if not found, generate a random sentence end$
or hmm end$
Will his reply start with one two three end$
Or will it be like he's finishing your sandwiches end$
let me think about this end$
I think I will just roll my own end$
so... end$
if I have an order 3 markov chain trained on the sentence "I really love dunnhumby so much" end$
and I look up the word "I" end$
I should find the chain ["I", "really", "love"] end$
then I can look up "really", which gives me ["really", "love", "dunnhumby"] end$
right? end$
and so on end$
yes end$
Yeah end$
so the interface would be something like end$
``` end$
string[] next(string word) // next("I") returns ["I", "really", "love"] end$
``` end$
except it's JS so no types end$
but you know what I mean end$
Kind of but you'll probably implement it as an object where the key is all the values concatenated end$
hmm end$
Otherwise your going to have to search an array of arrays every time end$
yeah end$
Instead of a hash lookup end$
all the values concatenated == use ["I", "really", "love"] as the key, and any word that followed "love" as the value? end$
or a list of words that has historically followed these 3 words, rather end$
hm no end$
then I have to find all the keys that start with a given word end$
i wish i remembered how hugo works, haskell is unreadable as fuck end$
why did i ever use haskell end$
this is what i readc end$
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5306729/how-do-markov-chain-chatbots-work> end$
first guys answer end$
nice thanks end$
yes you'd have to find all keys that start with that given word. I guess I optimised for the chain building and message generation with a large number of items. end$
if it becomes slow to find the keys that start with that token you can just build another map as a refernce end$
or use the first word as key, and the whole 3 word chain as part of the value, as well as the next word? end$
so it would be end$
#UIBUG end$
``` end$
{ end$
    "I": { end$
        chain: ["I", "really", "love"], end$
        next: "dunnhumby" end$
    } end$
} end$
``` end$
nah you cant do that because when building the chain, toi select the next value you take your current token PLUS the last values (up to chain length) and put that in the map end$
right end$
worker performance rating end$
FAILING end$
so it would be like (for chain length 2) end$
`sentence += "i really"` end$
`sentence += map['i really end$
etc end$
aha end$
in that case end$
dante how do i approve my exceptional passion end$
gibbo, Will work on without my consent end$
the key `"I really"` needs to store a `set` of the words that follows, to avoid duplicating the same word many times end$
does JS have a built in set-like data structure? end$
It does! end$
omg end$
I'm leaving duplicates as a kind of frequency thing tho end$
So the more one word follows another the more likely it is to get picked end$
you can also store them as pairs of (word, frequency) end$
if you are worried about memory usage end$
Yeah true end$
is this what I am looking for? <https://alligator.io/js/sets-introduction/> end$
yeah end$
dante, we never need your consent. You are ours to abuse. end$
dante crashes every time the slack connection is lost end$
stefan, Your suggestion doesn't handle requests end$
poor socket handling. end$
now the question is, how sensitive should it be when it comes to upper case vs lower case, special characters, etc end$
I think I will just not worry about that at all for now end$
so ITS and It's will be two entirely different entries end$
 Feed me gossip. I need entertaining. end$
Fine. I'll just make up my own. end$
yeah i didnt worry about it yet either end$
i will run my bot with a million comments and see how it is and tweak it after end$
<@U02V5S8CR> touched me inside the swimsuit area. He told me it should be our little secret. end$
you have a little secret in your swimsuit area? end$
:smile: end$
thats also why Im thinking im going to save the input data as a separate file end$
so i can change the parsing rules, chain length etc end$
without refetching all the commentsd end$
it will probably use several jiggawatts of energy end$
micro secret end$
I like to think of it as a lagom secret. end$

it's a special token denoting the end of a chain end$
it's just the empty string end$

dave jack dies for your sins end$
but right now you split on whitespace and add 1 end token at the end, so if input is multiple sentnecs youll only have end token? end$
I am feeling wonderful end$
&gt; add it to every line? end$
I do that with <@UER5B1RMW> end$
you are right, but that is fine for now end$
Marvellous end$

:dante: :dave: is leaving this friday end$
did they do? end$
need to figure out how to serialize the map to disk now end$
super easy end$
Leaving end of Thursday end$
:open_mouth: end$
`JSON.stringify(map)` and `JSON.parse(mapAsString)` end$
Where shall we have drinks on Friday? end$
oh wait you are using Map end$
btw, I discovered that `stringify` is also helpful for printing objects end$
yeah end$
`JSON.stringify(obj, null 2)` end$
will pretty print end$
Roter Rabe, Commune, Bohnengold, or BKK? end$
yep end$
good stuff end$
hmm end$
a lot of the time these days you can just console.log(obj) directly end$
...or Cake end$
..or coke end$
and if your console is good enough it will give you either a nice string represnetation, or sometimes even an interactive object in the console end$
LEAVING THE DREAM end$
the Map is just a regular JS object under the hood isnt it end$
I guess it must be end$
but what constructors does Map take? end$
or Lugosi end$
just the default one end$
You can't directly stringify the Map instance as it doesn't have any properties, but you can convert it to an array of tuples: end$
jsonText = JSON.stringify(Array.from(map.entries())); end$
For the reverse, use end$
map = new Map(JSON.parse(jsonText)); end$
I dont think `JSON.parse` will return you a nice map end$
OH nice end$
you can pass JSON to the constructor apparently end$
no there you are padding back an object not json end$
Lab.oratory end$
right end$

That reminds me of the time when the lord of mobile sent us on a wild goose chase over an endpoint that was "not working". He called it from his browser instead of the mobile app, and of course the browser sent a GET instead of a POST or whatever method it was. He denied it, but I looked through the logs and the user agent was clearly from a mac web browser and not an iPhone. end$

how can i make a JS map use the value of an array as key rather than the array reference itself end$
Not sure you can, you should string it instead end$
:disappointed: end$
Or check the map API end$
Maybe you can define the comparer end$
<@UFR8CJLFM> do you like programming? end$
programming are at odds end$
I think I got the algorithm right, just need to fix duplicated keys which seems to be caused by the above end$
Yeah most likely end$
You probably just want to make your keys 1 string joined by a space end$
Understand that ES2015 Map keys are compared as if with the === operator. Two array instances, even if they contain the same values, do not ever compare as === to each other. end$
hmm end$
i am trying to avoid slicing and stringifying lol end$
maybe I can subclass Map somehow end$
and override `get` to use `==`? end$
Maybe end$

my house today end$
You'll lose the efficiency unless you also implement Hashing etc end$
true end$
hmm end$
if i can stringify an array, is it easy to un-stringify it? end$
Yeah super easy end$
Your tokens won't have spaces end$
And spaces are your delimiter right end$
So tokens.join(' ') end$
To get the key end$
And key.spli(' ') end$
To get the tokens end$
Split end$
I'll go with that then, seems to be the best option here other than implementing a generic hashing map which is a bit overkill end$
cheers end$
yes end$

another dumb question end$
lets say i have a function like end$
``` end$
function foo() { end$
  for (...) { end$
    return x; end$
  } end$
} end$
``` end$
i know that it will always meet a condition in the loop that makes it return a value end$
but i want to indicate that if it exits the loop without returning, that is a programming error and the app should abort end$
in C or D I would use `assert(0)` or `assert(false)` here end$
what's the JS idiom? end$
Throw an exception after the for loop? end$
<@U3LNEPGP6> can you make some sexy women from this pic end$
<@UFT5H163V> nsfw avatars here only pls end$
I honestly don't think there is anything of the sort in JS end$

hmm ok end$
Yeah... In ndoe you can call exit () I think end$
`Please dont kill the messenger! ` always good to put in an email end$
And give a value end$
I'll use exit I think end$

exception to me means that there was an I/O error rather than a programmer logic error end$

It is with a subtle shade of sadness and rather hard to disguise delightful joy that I write to you all today to announce my departure from our company. For today is my last day, having been amongst you all for two years. end$
It has so far to date, been my most enjoyable working experience. I've had the pleasure of meeting many wonderful people with whom it's been a fantastic journey. One of the few certainties of life is change, and today for me, that has arrived. end$
In one week I will fly to Thailand where I will be for fifty days. Yes, I know what you are thinking, it'll be tough lounging about in 30c+ temperatures, exploring the cities, temples and beaches... but rest assured, never let it be said I am inconsiderate, I will be thinking of you all enjoying your cosy Berlin winter! :wink: end$
Berlin is very much my home now, so I will be returning to pursue other opportunities at the end of March (two hours before the official Brexit deadline :smile: ). end$

{"&lt;@UFTAL8WH4&gt; what if":["i"],"what if i":["have"],"if i have":[""quotes""],"i have "quotes"":["in"],"have "quotes" in":["some"],""quotes" in some":["of"],"in some of":["the"],"some of the":[""tokens""],"of the "tokens"":[""]} end$
``` end$
:disappointed: end$
need to escape those I guess end$
also im not sure why i have the {} end$
is there a function like `map()` for arrays that modifies an array in place rather than returning a new one? end$
so far i havent said a word in this meeting and i hope to keep it up end$
If you ever find yourself in a German prison and want to seek work this is the form use: <https://con.arbeitsagentur.de/prod/apok/ct/dam/download/documents/AB-Gefangene_ba013141.pdf> end$
FYI end$
A for loop? end$
you can just do .forEach end$
i want to modify the array in place end$
oh end$
you can do end$
`a.forEach( (value, index) =&gt; a[index]= 'cat' );` end$
``` end$
let arr = [1, 2, 3]; end$
arr.inPlaceMap(x =&gt; return x + 1); end$
// arr is now [2, 3, 4]; end$
``` end$
Just say "as so it was prophesied!" at the end of important sounding sentences that other people say. end$
hmm end$
actually end$
what i really want to do is escape quote characers with a backslash end$
so map wouldnt work end$
need to insert one element before end$
^ end$
i think you're potentially overcomplicatinng the serializer end$
yeah probably end$
you should just get the map key/values, and then map all the keys to `Array.from( map[key] )` to create an array from the sets end$
then you can just serialize/deserialize with toJSON end$
and avoid all that stuff end$
right end$
so i still need to iterate over the map and turn it into a JSON object? end$
you can even do `JSON.stringify( [ ...finalmap] )` then :stuck_out_tongue: end$
yes end$
ok end$
^ I did today end$
well end$
you need to make sure the object is serializable end$
that requires me to copy the whole map though end$
each time i want to serialize it end$
mm yeah thats true end$
not super efficient but it probably works for a bot that does it once every few minutes end$
so youll have one call to stirngify end$
I need to take a :shit: end$
what abotu this then: end$
stefan finally spoke end$
i said "two" end$
broke my vow of silence :disappointed: end$
well cone end$
and you laughed end$
lol end$
:happystefanwatches: end$
anus end$
yeah this function is looking unweildy already end$
comments out end$
``` end$
str = "" end$
iterate over key / values end$
     str += `"${JSON.stringify(key)}" : JSON.stringify(Array.from(value))` end$
``` end$
so then you are iterating, building the string while you iterate end$
and before + after you would need to add `{ and }` for json end$
i like it so far end$
without template strings its like : `str += '"' + JSON.stringify(key) + '" : ' + JSON.stringify(Array.from(Value))` end$
i like template strings a lot end$
and later you could change the string to a stream end$
and stream it to disk end$
not a bad idea end$
fs.createWriteStream? end$
Yeah something like that end$
ok end$
ill keep it simple for now end$
:recursivebob: :vomit: end$
lol end$
I have to say, this day is rather anticlimactic. end$
you had the boner and now it's gone? end$
stick around for a bit end$

For real? end$
Since the 1930s a dance permit ("danstillstånd") is required for public dance events in Sweden per the law of order (2 kap. 4 § ordningslagen 1993:1617). The Riksdag voted unanimously to abolish the requirement for a dance permit in 2016[1] but the law still exists and is enforced.[2] end$

A friend of ~mine~ is now working as a bartender in Norway. She says norwegians are the worst drunks ever, because they drink to get drunk fast. Everything closes at 3AM apparently. end$
also she gets like 100-200 euros in tips on some days. I'm in the wrong line of work. end$
sounds about right end$
norwegians have too much money and no sense end$
does she work in Oslo? end$
yep end$
then she's probably serving a lot of party swedes end$
they are the worst people in norway end$
she had two small beers for 5 euros and left a 5 euro tip. Tiago was confused as fuck. end$
lol end$
tipping isnt really a thing in scandinavia either end$
sometimes you might round up if you feel like it end$
maybe fancy bars in Oslo are different end$
<https://beccusbloggbok.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/go-home_89881850.jpg> end$
she works in a football bar. they have 8 screens inside and 4 outside end$
O'Learys? end$
it's a small bar she says end$
dunno the name, I could ask end$
O'Learys is a big chain end$
probably not a super fancy place then if they have sports end$
but its Oslo so a beer probably costs 250 dollars end$
when I was there I had a 33cl can of Carlsberg from the hotel room mini bar and had to pay 12 euros for it end$
also apparently you don't get served normally, you have to carry the drinks yourself to the table end$
depends on the place end$
sounds about right if its a "get drunk" type of bar end$
so its not fake news? end$
<@UG4L80ZK6> check Stefan’s elaborate answer in the thread <https://sociomanics.slack.com/conversation/CEQNUC9FU/p1550573679010300> end$
can you give me the TL;DR; version of it? end$
i dont quite understand it either end$
they removed the need for dancing permits, but still intend to enforce them? end$

let me know if you can spot the "Mixig bigint and other types" up in that bitch and illfix it up and smash another round end$
Maybe it's `i end$

when i call it I use fbib4(895n) end$
so num should be bigint end$
`num - 1` then? end$
1 is not a bigint end$

<@UES9JKGPQ> FOR REAL? LOL end$
I don't think he accepted it yet end$
"strict training"? end$
I just talked with :zsoltquake: and he said he either doesn't accept the offer for .NET end$
Or he does and then he will be in a training defined by them that will last quite some months end$
And any attitude he shows will be directly reported to HR end$

yep it's shit. And if you fix it anyway by avoiding Q and OKRs, then you don't get any recognition about it. By being proactive and going ahead of OKRs you are just SUCKSEEDING end$

Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone end$
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, end$
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, end$
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, end$
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read end$
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, end$
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; end$
And on the pedestal, these words appear: end$
My name is Bob, King of Kings; end$
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! end$
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay end$
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare end$
The lone and level sands stretch far away.” end$
I'll give you peeps a copy paste of this German woman doing a Dave on the plane from Chiang Mai to Krabi today... end$
:wutface: end$
"So I've just arrived in my hotel room in Ao Nang after flying from Chiang Mai and I had to deal with an emergency on the plane. I was sat in the middle of a row and there was a German woman in her 60s in the aisle seat next to me. 20 minutes before landing she looks at me with a slightly pale face and points up to the overhead storage, mumbles something about water then slumped unconscious with her head tipping towards the aisle. I immediately unbuckle my belt pull her upwards and start shouting for help. Word travels up the plane, the attendants come and someone shouts for a doctor. Two Americans get up and say they are doctors and take the woman out of her seat, lay her on the floor, and raise her legs. They get some fruit juice from the attendants after she started to recover. Eventually she is returned to her seat. I talk with her and she says she hadn't eaten since yesterday due to being ill. Turns out she is from Wilmersdorf in Berlin. She was examined at the airport. After I asked if she wanted to travel with me. Turns out she had a prepaid Taxi and offered me a ride to Ao Nang. I offered to pay towards it, she said it was fine seeing that she had paided for it already. So yes... a bit of drama :grinning:" end$
Note to Bob: The doctors did not attempt your repeated slapping in the face technique. end$
haha end$
what bob would do reminds me of a scene from Airplane! end$
He'd be the dude queuing with the wrench / spanner or the knuckle dusters. end$

btw, speaking of PIA the VPN. I've just learned that their CTO is this guy: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Karpel%C3%A8s> end$
The guy behind Mt. Gox, the bitcoin exchange that lost a lot of money. end$
&gt; On March 14, 2019, the Tokyo District Court found Karpeles guilty of falsifying data to inflate Mt. Gox’s holdings by $33.5 million, for which he was sentenced to 30 months in prison, suspended for four years, meaning he will serve no time unless he commits additional offenses over the next four years. end$
And he is probably very, very rich as a result end$
He allegedly recovered a large amount of BTC much later than the hack end$
And he had to pay back the BTC at the market value they had in 2013, which is peanuts compared to the value they have today. end$
Damn. end$

kotlin is pretty cool end$
now hopefully this actually works end$
I read about kotlin yesterday in the context of scala. Seems that they have a lot in common end$
scala is more "Pure" functional I think end$
no end$
yes end$
^ looks like it could work in scala end$
but his code is imperative end$
ohh yes, _more_ end$
yes and "pure" in quotes end$
even haskell isnt really "pure" end$
what does pb[key]!! mean? end$
Null assertion end$
Tells the compiler that i know this reference is not null don't worry about it end$
You have to use special operators when accessing nullable things end$
the compiler can infer it in certain cases, but not here apparently end$
had i put that line inside of an `else` for example, it would be enough to do `pb[key].` end$
you can also do `pb[key]?.something()` to tell the compiler you know that `pb[key]` might be null, and do nothing in case it is end$
but just the dot operator on a nullable reference is not allowed end$
I think it's a good thing, I remember in my days of being a java peon that NullPointerException was the bane of my existence end$
<@UFTAL8WH4> do u liek kotlin end$
talk metal to me end$
<@UFTAL8WH4> <@UER5B1RMW> snus burns so good :mmm: end$
of micromanagement but i resettle pops from those worlds to fresh worlds end$
that is actually pretty neat! end$
I wish D had it end$
yeah end$
there is also the "elvis operator" that you can use to put a default value in case it is null end$
`val numWords = pb[key]?.size ?: 0` gives `numWords` the value `0` if `pb[key]` is null end$
it's useful if you have long chains of nullable things end$
`val foo = pb[key]?.getBar()?.baz() ?: defaultFoo` end$
clojure is the only pure language out there end$

but when i walk away and it disconnects end$
then wont reconnect manually end$
the mac os UI says "cvheck if your mouse needs charging" end$

Hi All,

After 3 years, today is my last day at this awesome company. I want use this opportunity to say thanks to you all. It’s been an amazing ride with you all. From tropical island to RnD summits and summer parties, I will keep these lovely memories.

I’ve been privileged to be a member of the Sociomantic RnD department which resonates deeply to my core values. It was a park of genius and I really learnt a lot from everyone.

I also want to say thanks to the HuYu team. I wish you all the best in your endeavors.

Please feel free to reach out , here are my socials:

Hi All, 

After 3 years, today is my last day at this awesome company. I want use this opportunity to say thanks to you all. It’s been an amazing ride with you all. From tropical island to RnD summits and summer parties, I will keep these lovely memories.  

I’ve been privileged to be a member of the Sociomantic RnD department which resonates deeply to my core values. It was a park of genius and I really learnt a lot from everyone. 

I also want to say thanks to the HuYu team. I wish you all the best in your endeavors.

gabbo is currently 71 lines of kotlin :slightly_smiling_face: end$
nicw end$
<@UER5B1RMW> only for his markov chains his 138 end$
i'm also doing my book strangely
```
    var wordMap = HashMap&lt;Int, String&gt;()
    var pairMap = HashMap&lt;Int, Pair&lt;Int, Int&gt;&gt;()
    var chainMap = HashMap&lt;Int, MutableSet&lt;Int&gt;&gt;()
``` end$
words are stored as a map of hash to string, then there is a map of hash to pairs of words end$
then the final chain which is a list of next pair for a pair end$
yeah <@UER5B1RMW> is pretty much the same, but with him I’ve just partitioned the data into triplets and then i’ve partitioned this in pairs end$
^ end$
<@UHXAUKS4X> are you there? end$
you have to say?  end$
<@UHXAUKS4X> sorry you are about to lose your memory end$
words  end$
<@UHXAUKS4X> that's it? end$
the same, but with him I’ve just partitioned the data into triplets and then i’ve partitioned this in pairs  end$
<@UER5B1RMW> :wanna-fuck-gesture: <@UHXAUKS4X> end$
<@UHXAUKS4X> you're back for just a moment end$

Anyone here use the Windows subsystem for linux? end$

at :zalando:? end$
yep end$
first technical one end$
i’m doing some hacker rank challenges just to refresh me a bit end$
you can't access linux executables from windows, and you cant't install gui apps on subsystem. So you install you IDE on windows, but all your nicely managed packages are on subsystem which you can not access :confused:
But you can still access windows execs from the subsystem, which is kind of useless :confused: :confused: :confused: end$
is this something like wine or what? end$
lol it's reverse-wine end$
oh end$
